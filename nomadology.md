nomadology in [[deleuze]] (from [[a thousand plateaus]]) is decentering the fixed or grounded position of man or humanity in western thought. Nomadology frees thought from a fixed point of view or position of judgement, allowing thought to wander, move beyond recognized ground or home, to create new territories.
