the hero's journey or monomyth is a global narrative pattern in [[myth]] and [[literature]] found by Joseph Campbell. It is described in his book _The Hero with a Thousand Faces_. Similar patterns can be found, e.g. kish≈çtenketsu. The Hero has to confront [[chaos]].

Showrunner and writer Dan Harmon has adapted the hero's journey into a simplified form he calls the story circle.
