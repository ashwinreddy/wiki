a medium is a way of communicating, e.g. television, books, movies. It is a type of [[technology]]. 

In _Laws of Media_, Eric and Marshall McLuhan ask four questions of a medium.

1. How does the medium retrieve something obsolescent?
2. How does it reverse the original characteristics?
3. What does it obsolesce?
4. What does it enhance?

## Medium is the message

This famous saying by Marshall McLuhan is more radical than it seems. What McLuhan means is that a medium is more important than any particular instance of the medium. That is, the practices and culture of television, to pick one medium, are far more important than any particular television show that exists.
