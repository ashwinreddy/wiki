interpretation is the act of making [[meaningness]] of any system that shows [[emergence]]. It is related to the concept of [[explanation]].

In Edward Tufte's _Visual Explanations_, he uses John Snow's visual analysis of the cholera outbreak from _On the Mode of Communication of Cholera_, which helped solve the cholera epidemic. On the other hand, the Challenger disaster showed how the displays need to tell a clear story.

> There are right ways and wrong ways to show data; there are displays that reveal the truth and displays that do not. -- Tufte

Here is what [[deleuze]] had to say about interpretation of the [[book]] as a [[sign]]. 

> There are, you see, two ways of reading a book: you either see it as a box with something inside and start looking for what it signifies, and then if you're even more perverse or depraved you set off after signifiers. And you treat the next book like a box contained in the first or containing it. And you annotate and interpret and question, and write a book about the book, and so on and on. Or there's the other way: you see the book as a little non-signifying machine, and the only question is "Does it work, and how does it work?" How does it work for you? If it doesn't work, if nothing comes through, you try another book. This second way of reading's intensive: something comes through or it doesn't. There's nothing to explain, nothing to understand, nothing to interpret.

This is a stance close to [[pragmatism]].
