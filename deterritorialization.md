deterritorialization is a [[concept]] from [[capitalism and schizophrenia]].

> deterritorialization is defined as the movement or process by which something escapes or departs from a given territory, where a territory can be a [[system]] of any kind: conceptual, linguistic, social, or affective. -- Paul Patton

in addition, deterritorialization is "inseperable from correlative [[reterritorialization]]s" (509). whether the deterritorialization is negative or positive depends on whether the [[line of flight]] passes over [[reterritorialization]] or not. 

there is a [[virtual]] vs. actual distinction they invoke as well. absolute deterritorialization occurs in the virtual realm while relative deterritorialization occurs only in the actual.
