emergence is when a self-organizing [[system]] displays more complex properties than its constituents. Hence, emergentism is antithetical to reductionism, i.e. emergent phenomena are not easily reducible to their parts. This poses a difficulty for classical methods of [[science]]. 

Andrew Assad and Norman H. Packard argue that emergence is a spectrum. We could imagine roughly sketching the axis like so.[^spectrum]

|Category|Meaning|
|---------|-------|
|Non-emergent|Behavior is immediately deducible upon inspection of the specification or rules generating it.|
|Weakly emergent|Behavior is deducible in hindsight from the specification after observing the behavior.|
|Strongly emergent|Behavior is deducible in theory, but its elucidation is prohibitively difficult.|
|Maximally emergent|Behavior is impossible to deduce from the specification.|

What emerges is either: structure, computation, or functionality.
