The **SI model** models the spread of a disease among a population of $N$ people who are either either susceptible (S) or infected (I), which means

$$
S+I = N.
$$

The probability that a random pair has one infected and one susceptible, for large $N$, is given by

$$
2\frac{S}{N}\frac{I}{N} = \frac{2}{N^2}SI
$$
