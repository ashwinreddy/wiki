Inflation rate can be measured as a percent change in CPI.

Inflation is not in and of itself bad for the economy. When things are going well, prices may rise. The government targets 2% inflation each year.


What would cause an increase in price? A rightward shift in demand or a leftward shift in supply. The resulting inflation is called demand-pull or cost-push, respectively. 

In demand-pull inflation, the total economic quantity (real GDP) also increases whereas cost-push inflation causes a decrease in real GDP and maybe also unemployment.

: If a leftward shift in supply creates problems for the economy, then a rightward shift must be great.
