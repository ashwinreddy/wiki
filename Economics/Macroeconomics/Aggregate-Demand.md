**Aggregate demand** is the demand for all of a nation's goods and services. Like market demand, it is downward sloping. Why?

|Microeconomic Effect|Macroeconomic Effect|
|-------------------|--------------------|
|Income effect|Real balance / wealth effect|
|Substitution effect|Foreign purchases / Net exports effect|
||Interest Rate Effect|

As prices in the aggregate economy increase, the output decreases because

Real balance effect
: An increase in price levels means consumers have less purchasing power. Therefore, consumer spending decreases.

Foreign purchases or net exports effect
: An increase in price levels makes the nation's goods more expensive. We buy more foreign goods and foreigners stop purchasing our goods. Net exports go down because imports increase.

Interest rate effect
: An increase in price level means there is a higher demand for money, a higher nominal interest rate ensues, and consumer and investment spending decrease

Government spending is not included in these effects, because government spending is arbitrary and not dictated by market forces.

# Shifting AD

What shifts AD is a shift in Y. 

First, what causes consumer spending to rise?

- An increase in disposable income (income after taxes)
- Wealth increase (house value or stocks increase)
- Consumer confidence in the economy

Key determinants of investment: How much profit can I earn on this capital?

The true cost of capital is interest you could be earning (lower interest rate, higher spending)

Again, confidence in the economy increases spending.

Ke determinants of government spending: arbitrary

Key determinants of exports: Foreign income levels and exchange rates. Say 1 dollar is 7 euros. Then 1 dollar is 10 euros. The dollar appreciated in value and the euro depreciated in value.
