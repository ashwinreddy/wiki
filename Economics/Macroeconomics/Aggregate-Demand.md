**Aggregate demand** is the demand for all of a nation's goods and services. Like market demand, it is downward sloping. Why?

|Income effect|Real balance / wealth effect|
|Substitution effect|Foreign purchases / Net exports effect|
||Interest Rate Effect|

As prices in the aggregate economy increase, the output decreases because

Real balance effect
: An increase in price levels means consumers have less purchasing power. Therefore, consumer spending decreases.

Foreign pruchases or net exports effect
: An increase in price levels makes the nation's goods more expensive. We buy more foreign goods and foreigners stop purchasing our goods. **DOES THIS INCREASE OR DECREASE $X_n$?**
