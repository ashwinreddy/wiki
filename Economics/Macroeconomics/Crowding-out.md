**Crowding out** is a result of expansionary [[fiscal policy]].

# Chain Reaction

The government spending creates a budget deficit (spending > income). This deficit forces the government to take out loans, increasing the demand in the [[loanable funds]] market. That in turn raises the real interest rate, lowering investment spending and capital and long run growth.

\begin{align}
\text{Budget Deficit} \implies D_{LF} \rightarrow \implies r \uparrow \implies I \uparrow \implies & K\downarrow \implies LRG \downarrow \\\
\implies & AD \leftarrow
\end{align}
