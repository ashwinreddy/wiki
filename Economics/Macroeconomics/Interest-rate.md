Interest rate is inversely related to bond prices. Here's why:

- Suppose the interest rate goes up. Existing bonds become less valuable because they are not paying off as much. You have to decrease their price.
- Suppose the interest rate goes down. Existing bonds become more valuable because they are paying off quite a bit. You should increase the price.
