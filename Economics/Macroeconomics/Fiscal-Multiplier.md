Whenever somebody earns money, they can decide to do one of two things with it: spend it or save it. 

Imagine Alice spends a fraction of her disposable income at Bob's shop. Bob then takes that money and spends part of that at Charlie's shop. This continues as a geometric series, which allows us to say that

\begin{equation}
\text{SM} \equiv \frac{1}{\text{MPS}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\text{SM} = \frac{1}{1-\text{MPC}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\Delta Y = \text{SM} \times \Delta \left(\text{Spending}\right)
\end{equation}
