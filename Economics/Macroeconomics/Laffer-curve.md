The Laffer curve describes the relationship between expected tax revenue and tax rate. On the extreme cases, we have 0% and 100% tax rate. In both of these cases, we expect not to get any tax revenue. If there is no tax, you can't have tax revenue; however, if you charge 100% tax rate, why would anybody work?

However, there must be an increase between the two points. Thus, we must see a curve like the following:

This means that reducing the tax rate may actually create higher revenue, depending on the empirical curve and where we currently sit.
