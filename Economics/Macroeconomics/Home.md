The goal of macroeconomics is to stabilize the [[business cycle]] while growing our level of real output over time, which is measured by [[GDP]]. The problems we face in trying to accomplish these tasks are [[inflation]] and [[unemployment]].

Until 1700, the real GPD per capita was basically constant. Before then, the standard of living was kind of the same as it had been for hundreds of years. For the three hundred years between 1700 and now, there's been about a 2% growth in real GDP per capita.

What can we actually do to grow the economy? Push out the frontier of the PPC. To do that, we need better quantity and/or quality of resources. Recall our four factors:

- Land
- Labor
- Capital
- Entrepreneurship

We're going to consider land to be basically fixed. It's not really expandable unless we conquer land, and its quality cannot be easily enhanced. So we discard land.

For labor, a higher quantity of labor doesn't really help because if those people are just producing at the same rate as everyone else, then they might be increasing real GDP, but real GDP per capita stays the same. So what we care about is the quality of labor.

Finally, capital and entrepreneurship are always good to have.

From this, we create a list of keys to economic growth.
