The goal of macroeconomics is to stabilize the [[business cycle]] while growing our level of real output over time, which is measured by [[GDP]]. The problems we face in trying to accomplish these tasks are [[inflation]] and [[unemployment]].

What can we actually do to grow the economy? Push out the frontier of the PPC. To do that, we need better quantity and/or quality of resources. Recall our four factors:

- Land
- Labor
- Capital
- Entrepreneurship

We're going to consider land to be basically fixed. It's not really expandable unless we conquer land, and its quality cannot be easily enhanced. So we discard land.

For labor, a higher quantity of labor doesn't really help because if those people are just producing at the same rate as everyone else, then they might be increasing real GDP, but real GDP per capita stays the same. So what we care about is the quality of labor.

Finally, capital and entrepreneurship are always good to have.

From this, we create a list of keys to economic growth.

- Better people, which in economic terms is called better human capital. Influenced by quality of education.
- Capital Stock (K) influenced by interest rate
- Better quality capital, or technology, influenced by research
