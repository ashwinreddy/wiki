The money market is the market for holding wealth in the form of money as opposed to another financial asset. The price of money is the opportunity cost on the rate of return on another asset, which is the interest rate.

# Demand for Money

The demand for money $D_m$ is split into two components: asset demand for money $D_a$ and transaction demand for money $D_t$.

The transaction demand for money is due to the fact that cash is very liquid and you can use it to buy stuff. The asset demand is due to money being a financial asset. It is effectively equal to the [[velocity of money]].

A higher interest rate means a higher opportunity cost to holding cash, which means asset demand is downward sloping.

Overall, $D_m$ is downward sloping.

Shifters:

- A change in nominal GDP
- Credit card fees go down

# Supply of Money

The supply of money is fixed, so it is a vertical graph.

The Fed controls the money supply:

- Buying and selling bonds
- Changing the reserve requirement
- Changing the discount rate
