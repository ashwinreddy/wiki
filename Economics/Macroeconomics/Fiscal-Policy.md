**Fiscal policy** is government (president/congress) response to macroeconomic problems. There are two tools: changing personal income taxes or changing government spending. Both tools affect [[aggregate demand]]: changing the personal income tax changes individuals' disposable incomes, allowing them to spend more or less, which affects the $C$ component of [[GDP]]. Government spending _is_ the $G$ component of [[GDP]].

|                   | Expansionary | Contractionary |
|-------------------|-------|----------------------|
|Taxes| Decrease | Increase |
|Government Spending |Increase | Decrease |

The goal of expansionary policy is to increase [[aggregate demand]] and the goal of contractionary policy is to decrease it.

# Automatic and Discretionary Policy

Automatic fiscal policy stabilizes the economy without new laws. Automatic stabilizers are the result of need-based programs or progressive taxes. These policies attempt yo create a stable equilibrium by automatically counteract the stray from equilibrium. 

Suppose the economy begins to boom and incomes are rising. Then a progressive tax will kick in and contractionary policy is automatically being put in place.

Suppose to the economy slows down and incomes are dropping. Need-based programs like welfare will kick in because more people qualify, and government spending will increase.

Discretionary policy on the other hand requires new laws to be put in place.
