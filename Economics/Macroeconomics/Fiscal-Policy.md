**Fiscal policy** is government (president/congress) response to macroeconomic problems. There are two tools: changing personal income taxes or changing government spending. Both tools affect [[aggregate demand]]: changing the personal income tax changes individuals' disposable incomes, allowing them to spend more or less, which affects the $C$ component of [[GDP]]. Government spending _is_ the $G$ component of [[GDP]].
