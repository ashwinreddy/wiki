**Fiscal policy** is government (president/congress) response to macroeconomic problems. There are two tools: changing personal income taxes or changing government spending. Both tools affect [[aggregate demand]]: changing the personal income tax changes individuals' disposable incomes, allowing them to spend more or less, which affects the $C$ component of [[GDP]]. Government spending _is_ the $G$ component of [[GDP]].

|                   | Expansionary | Contractionary |
|-------------------|-------|----------------------|
|Taxes| Decrease | Increase |
|Government Spending |Increase | Decrease |

The goal of expansionary policy is to increase [[aggregate demand]] and the goal of contractionary policy is to decrease it.
