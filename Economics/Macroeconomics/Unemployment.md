A person is **unemployed** if they are part of the [[labor force]] but cannot find a job. From this definition, we can summarize by saying that an unemployed person is actively looking for a job while not having one.

\begin{equation}
\text{Unemployment Rate} = \frac{\text{Unemployed}}{\text{Labor Force}}
\end{equation}

As a statistic, the unemployment rate is skewed. If you decide to start working, until you find a job, you will be increasing unemployment. However, we would consider your entering the market an economic positive. Similarly, if you decide to stop looking or retire, you decrease unemployment. But a **discouraged worker**, somebody who decides to stop looking for employment, is not considered a good thing.

The government targets 4 to 5% unemployment. There is never 0% unemployment, nor is that the target.

# Types of Unemployment

The kind of unemployment dictates the appropriate policy response.

- Frictional unemployment is when a person's skills and a market match, but they just need time to find each other. LinkedIn targets people who face frictional unemployment
- Structural unemployment is when a person's skills and the market do not match. For example, ATM replaces tellers. From a policy perspective, we either ban ATMs or train tellers to maintain ATMs. Between these two options, we should tend towards something like the latter. The market is stronger than people, so making people work for the market and not the other way around is more sustainable. In real life, an example is the government subsidizing coal production.
- Cyclical unemployment is due to the business cycle
- Seasonal unemployment is due to seasons. Farmers hired for the harvest. Retail workers for the holiday season.
