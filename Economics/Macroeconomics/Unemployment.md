A person is **unemployed** if they are willing and able to work but cannot find a job. From this definition, we can summarize by saying that an unemployed person is actively looking for a job while not having one.

\begin{equation}
\text{Unemployment Rate} = \frac{\text{Unemployed}}{\text{Labor Force}}
\end{equation}

As a statistic, the unemployment rate is skewed. If you decide to start working, until you find a job, you will be increasing unemployment. However, we would consider your entering the market an economic positive. Similarly, if you decide to stop looking or retire, you decrease unemployment. But a **discouraged worker**, somebody who decides to stop looking for employment, is not considered a good thing.

The government targets 4 to 5% unemployment
