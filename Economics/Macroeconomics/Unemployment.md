A person is **unemployed** if they are willing and able to work but cannot find a job. From this definition, we can summarize by saying that an unemployed person is actively looking for a job while not having one.

\begin{equation}
\text{Unemployment Rate} = \frac{\text{Unemployed}}{\text{Labor Force}}
