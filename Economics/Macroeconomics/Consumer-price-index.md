**Consumer price index** (or **CPI**) is a price index for household purchases. It measures the average prices in the final goods and services market. In practice, we imagine collecting a basket of goods each year and comparing those prices.

CPI is measured w.r.t. a base year. 

\begin{equation}
\text{CPI } = \frac{\text{bundle cost in current year}}{\text{bundle cost in base year}} \times 100
\end{equation}

Clearly, we can intuit that

|CPI|Interpretation|
|---|--------------|
|>100|Prices have gone up compared to the base year|
|< 100| Prices have gone down compared to the base year|
|= 100|Prices are the same as they were in the base year|
