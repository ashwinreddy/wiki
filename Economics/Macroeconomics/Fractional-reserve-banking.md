In fractional-reserve banking, banks have to keep a certain proportion of the deposits on hand. Cash in a bank is called reserves, and the fractional reserve banking system prevents panics or runs on banks. Reserves can be used by the bank to make loans but the Federal Reserve Banks have to make sure that people/banks get their money back if they want it. Excess reserves are reserves that the bank is not required to keep because of the reserve requirement.
