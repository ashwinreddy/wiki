An **intermediate good** is one that it is used to produce something else. Some goods can be intermediate in some circumstances and final in others.

Intermdiate goods are not counted in [[GDP]] to prevent counting the value of the goods over and over again. If one wants to consider intermdiate sellers, sum up the value added (the wages, profit, interest, and rent earned upon selling).
