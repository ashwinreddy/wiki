There are three functions of money:

- A medium of exchange. This makes it possible to avoid the coincidence of wants. People use money as an intermediate which they can use to buy other things.
- A unit of account. Money makes it possible to compare the value of objects of different types.
- A store of value. You can use money to store value to society and preserve it until you need it later.

Hyperinflation undermines money's ability to store value, thereby making it a bad medium of exchange, and then a unit of monetary account.
