There are three functions of money:

- A medium of exchange. This makes it possible to avoid the coincidence of wants. People use money as an intermediate which they can use to buy other things.
- A unit of account. Money makes it possible to compare the value of objects of different types.
- A store of value. You can use money to store value to society and preserve it until you need it later.

The value of money is determined by

- its acceptability
- designation as legal tender
- relative stability, which depends on the government's ability

Hyperinflation undermines money's ability to store value, thereby making it a bad medium of exchange, and then a unit of monetary account. 

The face value of money needs to be higher than its intrinsic value to prevent the money from being destroyed or melted down and resold for a higher price than it is worth. 

The purchasing power of the dollar varies inversely with price level. The [[central bank]] tries to maintain money's purchasing power.
