The fed uses monetary policy to control the money supply. An increase in the money supply is called expansionary monetary policy. A decrease in the money supply is called contractionary monetary policy.

The discount rate is the interest rate the Feds charge the bank. The federal funds rate is the rate banks charge each other. Expansionary policies decrease the interest rate.


| |Expansionary | Contractionary|
|--|--|--|
|Reserve requirement|Decrease|Increase|
|Open market operations|Buy bonds|Sell bonds|
|Discount rate|Decrease|Increase|

If the reserve requirement is high, then banks have to keep a lot of money on hand. Then they can't loan out that much, which means the money supply is low. If the reserve requirement is low, then banks have a lot of money on hand, they loan out a lot, and the money supply is high.

If the Fed buys bonds, that's money that goes into the hands of banks and people, increasing the ability to make loans, and growing the economy.

If the discount rate is low, banks can borrow more easily, increase their excess reserves, and make more loans.
