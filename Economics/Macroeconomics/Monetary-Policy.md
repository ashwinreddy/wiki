The fed uses monetary policy to control the money supply. An increase in the money supply is called expansionary monetary policy. A decrease in the money supply is called contractionary monetary policy.

The discount rate is the interest rate the Feds charge the bank. The federal funds rate is the rate banks charge each other. Expansionary policies decrease the interest rate.
