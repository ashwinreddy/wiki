The **Fisher equation** is the approximation

\begin{equation}
\text{real rate} = \text{nom rate} - \text{inflation rate}
\end{equation}

The Fisher equation enables one to determine whether a party benefits from a change in inflation. For example, suppose workers receive a 20% increase in their nominal wages while facing inflation of 50%. The percent change in real wages would be 20% - 50% or -30%. In other words, the workers received increased wages, but their wages did not increase as fast as the value of money decreased. 

Borrowers under a fixed-interest-rate loan are happy to see inflation. Why? A fixed interest rate loan is effectively like locking the nominal rate in place and keeping it constant. If inflation rate increases, then the real rate must be decreasing. In other words, buyers are paying back with the same nominal amount of money because it is fixed-rate but because of inflation, that money is worth less.
