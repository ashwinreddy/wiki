The **Fisher equation** is the approximation

\begin{equation}
\text{real }\% = \text{nom }\% - \text{inflation } \%
\end{equation}

The Fisher equation enables one to determine whether a party benefits from a change in inflation. For example, suppose workers receive a 20% increase in their nominal wages while facing inflation of 50%. The percent change in real wages would be 20% - 50% or -30%. In other words, the workers received increased wages, but their wages did not increase as fast as the value of money decreased.
