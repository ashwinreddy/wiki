In economics, a **nominal value** is measured using dollars from that year while its **real value** counterpart is adjusted for inflation / deflation.

# GDP

\begin{equation}
\text{Real }Y = \frac{\text{Nominal } Y}{\text{CPI}}\times 100
\end{equation}

Conceptually, this is kind of like

\begin{equation}
Q = \frac{P_0 \times Q}{P}
\end{equation}
