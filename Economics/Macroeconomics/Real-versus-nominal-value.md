In economics, a **nominal value** is measured using dollars from that year while its **real value** counterpart is adjusted for inflation / deflation.

# GDP

Nominal GDP measures today's prices times today's quantities. Real GDP uses base year prices times today's quantity.

\begin{equation}
\text{Real }Y = \frac{\text{Nominal } Y}{\text{CPI}}\times 100
\end{equation}

Conceptually, this is kind of like saying

\begin{equation}
Q \equiv \frac{P_0 \times Q_0}{P}
\end{equation}
