**Gross domestic product** (**GDP**) is the total (gross) dollar amount of all the final goods and services (product) produced by a country (domestic) in a given time period. GDP is basically a measure of the total value produced by a nation in that it is the total quantity produced times the average market value of all the things produced. So in some sense, it is like the country's total revenue. It is a key variable in the study of macroeconomics. GDP has [real and nominal](./Real-versus-nominal-values) quantities.

- We need to use dollar amount to compare different goods and services. A country that makes 1 house is economically more productive than one that makes six shirts because the house has more value to society (it costs more)
- Final good or service is one that isn't used to make another good or service. A sandwich's price includes the value of its constituents. Some goods can be final in one scenario and not final in an another (purchasing a tomato at a farmer's market versus tomato in ketchup)
- Where it is produced (American selling a Mexican car; the car was made in Mexico, it contributes to Mexico's GDP)
- When it is produced.

What is not included in the GDP?

- Black market goods. Drugs, murder, babysitting. 
- Abroad (made outside of the country)
- Nonproduction transaction (e.g. birthday gifts, food stamps, stocks, transfer payment (gov't gives money but not for a good or service))
- Nonmarket production: fixing your own car, make your own vegetables, raise your own children
- Double counting: intermediate goods and second hand sales do not count

Rental payments always count regardless of the age of a good or service. Therefore, interest on a loan counts (but not the principal).

We measure GDP by spending.

- Consumer spending
- Investments - business spendnig on capital and all new housing
- Government spending
- Net exports
