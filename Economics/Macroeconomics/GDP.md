**Gross domestic product** (**GDP**) is the total (gross) dollar amount of all the final goods and services (product) produced by a country (domestic) in a given time period. GDP is basically a measure of the total value produced by a nation in that it is the total quantity produced times the average market value of all the things produced. So in some sense, it is like the country's total revenue. It is a key variable in the study of macroeconomics. GDP has [real and nominal](./Real-versus-nominal-value) quantities.


We can measure GDP by spending or by earnings, but typically we use spending.

- Consumer spending
- Investments - business spendnig on capital and all new housing
- Government spending
- Net exports

This yields

\begin{equation}
Y \equiv C + I + G + X_{net}
\end{equation}

# Expenditures included

GDP is a monetary measure because we need to use dollar amount to compare different goods and services. We can only say a country that makes 1 house is economically more productive than one that makes six shirts because the house has more value to society as it costs more.

Only [[final good]]s and services produced in the country and in that year are counted.

# Expenditures not included

- Black market goods. Drugs, murder, babysitting. 
- Abroad (made outside of the country)
- Nonproduction transaction (e.g. birthday gifts, food stamps, stocks, transfer payment (gov't gives money but not for a good or service))
- Nonmarket production: fixing your own car, make your own vegetables, raise your own children
- Double counting: intermediate goods and second hand sales do not count

Rental payments always count regardless of the age of a good or service. Therefore, interest on a loan counts (but not the principal).
