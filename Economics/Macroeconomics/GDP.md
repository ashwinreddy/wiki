**Gross domestic product** (**GDP**) is the total (gross) dollar amount of all the final goods and services (product) produced by a country (domestic) in a given time period. GDP is basically a measure of the total value produced by a nation in that it is the total quantity produced times the average market value of all the things produced. So in some sense, it is like the country's total revenue. It is a key variable in the study of macroeconomics. GDP has [real and nominal](./Real-versus-nominal-value) quantities.

GDP is a monetary measure because we need to use dollar amount to compare different goods and services. We can only say a country that makes 1 house is economically more productive than one that makes six shirts because the house has more value to society as it costs more.

Only [[final good]]s and services produced in the country and in that year are counted. Intermediate goods and second hand sales do not count. Obviously, black market goods (e.g. drugs, murder, babysitting) and nonmarket productions cannot be counted. By definition, goods produced outside the country do not count. Finally, nonproduction transactions like birthday gifts, food stamps, stocks, and [[transfer payment]]s do not count.


Rental payments always count regardless of the age of a good or service. Therefore, interest on a loan counts (but not the principal).

We typically measure GPD by spending, but we can also use earnings. When measuring by spending, the breakdown is as follows:

- Consumer spending
- Investments - business spending on capital and all new housing
- Government spending
- [[Net exports]]

This yields

\begin{equation}
Y \equiv C + I + G + X_{net}
\end{equation}

# Real GDP

Adjusting GDP requires the use of a price index.
