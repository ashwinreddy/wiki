The M1 money supply includes only that which can be used directly for transactions: cash in circulation and checkable/demand deposits (e.g. debit cards). Credit cards and bonds are not considered part of the money supply.

\begin{equation}
\text{M1 = CIC + Checkable Deposits}
\end{equation}

The M2 money supply includes the M1 money supply plus near monies, which are like 1 step away from direct use (e.g. savings accounts).

\begin{equation}
\text{M2 = M1 + Savings Accounts}
\end{equation}
