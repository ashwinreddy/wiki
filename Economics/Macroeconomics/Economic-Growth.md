**Economic growth** is a percent change in real GDP.

What can we actually do to grow the economy? Push out the frontier of the PPC. To do that, we need better quantity and/or quality of resources. Recall the [[factors of production]]: Land, Labor, Capital, Entrepreneurship.

We're going to consider land to be basically fixed. It's not really expandable unless we conquer land, and its quality cannot be easily enhanced. So we discard land.

For labor, a higher quantity of labor doesn't really help because if those people are just producing at the same rate as everyone else, then they might be increasing real GDP, but real GDP per capita stays the same. So what we care about is the quality of labor.

Finally, capital and entrepreneurship are always good to have.

From this, we create a list of keys to economic growth.
