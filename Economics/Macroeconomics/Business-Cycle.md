The **business cycle** is the GDP as a function of time, typically with the following periodic sequence: expansion, a peak where we need to minimize inflation, recession, and a trough where we need to minimize unemployment.

**Missing graph, include from notes**

You can imagine that the business cycle could be roughly modelled with $ax+\sin(bx)$ and that our goal is to maximize $a$ and to minimize $|b|$.

Reasons for the biz cycle include shocks, money, and technology bubbles.
