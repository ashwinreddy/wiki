The **loanable funds** market is the market for loans, distinct from the [[money market]]. The price of a loan is the real interest rate paid on that loan. The real rate is just the nominal rate adjusted for expected inflation.

The demand for loans comes from business investments and the government. 


\begin{equation}
D_{LF} = D_I + D_G
\end{equation}

The supply of loans comes from somebody with savings looking for a rate of return. Banks simply mediate the transactions. So the supply of loans is simply just savings.

## Shifters of Demand

- Higher demand corresponds to the expected return on investment
- Higher business confidence
- Government borrowing
- Higher consumer borrowing

Remember, a change in the real interest rate is not a shift in demand.

## Shifters of Supply

- Expectations of a recession correspond to higher savings
- foreign savings
- political instability

> Savings always flows to wherever it gets the best risk-adjusted rate of return
