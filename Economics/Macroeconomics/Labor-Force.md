The **labor force** includes all those who are willing and able to work. If one is in the labor force, he or she must necessarily be either employed or [unemployed](./Unemployment). The population not in the labor force includes discouraged workers, children, etc.

If you are underemployed (your skills are not being fully utilized in your job) or part-time or own your own firm, you are employed.

\begin{equation}
\text{LFPR} = \frac{\text{Labor Force}}{\text{Population}}
