The **Phillips curve** is a model that describes unemployment and inflation.

# Shifting

A change in [[aggregate demand]] means a point shift along the curve. A change in [[aggregate supply]] left or right creates the opposite change in the Phillips curve. 

# Long Run

In the long run, the Phillips curve shows that unemployment is at the natural rate of unemployment, which is independent of inflation.
