**Economics** is the study of choice, specifically how people make choices to satisfy competing needs and wants given that there are limited resources. We call this idea of limited resources scarcity.

Our economic models will have some assumptions:

1. Resources exist in scarcity
2. The ability to choose between options implies a cost no matter what is chosen
3. People behave rationally
4. People and policies are predictable

Economic statements can be positive or normative. Positive statements are factual (either true or false) while normative statements are equipped with a value judgement.

Economies sit on a spectrum between command or centrally planned economies and market economies, with those in between being mixed economies. 

In a command economy, the government decides what gets made and it owns the resources. On the other hand, a market economy allows for private property and free enterprise.
