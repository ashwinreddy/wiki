**Economics** is the study of choice, namely how people satisfy competing needs and wants with limited resources. 

Assumptions:

1. Scarcity exists
2. Nothing is obtained for free
3. People are rational
4. People and policies are predictable

Economies sit on a spectrum between command or centrally planned economies and market economies, with those in between being mixed economies. 

In a command economy, the government decides what gets made and it owns the resources. On the other hand, a market economy allows for private property and free enterprise.
