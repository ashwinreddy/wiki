thinkers of difference include [[heidegger]], [[deleuze]], and [[jacques derrida]], the goal being to show that identity is conditioned by difference rather than the other way around. 

derrida's deconstruction, in which identity is always covering up its difference, prevents us from ever getting a grip on identity. 

for deleuze, difference is understood as part of the edge of [[chaos]] of a [[system]]. philosophy mediates between the stable and the [[deterritorialization]]. too much stability -- clich√©. too much instability -- nonsense.

the concept that does this work in [[a thousand plateaus]] is the abstract machine of double articulation (first, consistency leading to second, unpredictability). identities, then, depend on abstract machines. it will also involve the [[BwO]], [[event]], [[rhizome]]. jeffrey bell says this is in line with a [[kant]]ian critique of finding the limits of abstract machines. 

when deleuze and [[guattari]] say [[god]] is a lobster, they are saying he is both the abstract machine drawing chaos / [[BwO]] into consistency and also its own systems.
