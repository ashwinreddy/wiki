thinkers of difference include [[hegel]], [[heidegger]], [[deleuze]], and [[jacques derrida]], the goal being to show that identity is conditioned by difference rather than the other way around. 

## hegel

hegel objected to what he called 'indifferent difference.' that difference which is simply an external relation between self-present beings. for hegel, difference was absolute and negative. there is no being or identity without difference.  

## heidegger

## deleuze

heidegger's being is deleuze's difference. 

for deleuze, difference is understood as part of the edge of [[chaos]] of a [[system]]. philosophy mediates between the stable and the [[deterritorialization]]. too much stability -- clich√©. too much instability -- nonsense.

the concept that does this work in [[a thousand plateaus]] is the abstract machine of double articulation (first, consistency leading to second, unpredictability). identities, then, depend on abstract machines. it will also involve the [[BwO]], [[event]], [[rhizome]]. jeffrey bell says this is in line with a [[kant]]ian critique of finding the limits of abstract machines. 

when deleuze and [[guattari]] say [[god]] is a lobster, they are saying he is both the abstract machine drawing chaos / [[BwO]] into consistency and also its own systems. 

- positive vs. negative difference

## derrida

derrida's deconstruction, in which identity is always covering up its difference, prevents us from ever getting a grip on identity.
