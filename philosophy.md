philosophy happens when [[friend]]s of wisdom create [[concept]]s ([[socrates]]; [[deleuze]]) discuss ([[rorty]]) how to direct their lives ([[seneca]]) and dispel misconceptions that hinder them ([[wittgenstein]]). A philosopher is not necessarily a [[sage]] but a friend of the sage.

in [[epistulae morales ad lucilium]] letter 16, seneca writes

> _Non est philosophia populare artificium nec ostentationi paratum. Non in verbis, sed in rebus est. Nec in hoc adhibetur, ut cum aliqua oblectatione consumatur dies, ut dematur otio nausia. Animum format et fabricat, vitam disponit, actiones regit, agenda et omittenda demonstrat, sedet ad gubernaculum et per ancipitia fluctuantium derigit cursum. Sine hac nemo intrepide potest vivere, nemo secure. Innumerabilia accidunt singulis horis, quae consilium exigant, quod ab hac petendum est._

In [[empiricism and subjectivity]], deleuze says

> a philosophical theory is an elaborately developed question, and nothing else; by itself and in itself, it is not the resolution to a problem, but the elaboration, to the very end, of the necessary implications of a formulated question.

For him, there are 4 critical responses to philosophy:

1. The question raised by a philosopher is not a good one.
2. We should raise it in a better way.
3. We should raise a different question.
4. It does not force the nature of things enough (philosophy as interrogation).

## Resources

Getting into philosophy is rewarding but difficult. Here are my recommendations for beginners.

1. Start with what's interesting. For me, it was [[stoic]]ism, esp. Marcus Aurelius. 
2. Good general background resources are the podcast [Philosophize This](https://www.philosophizethis.org/) and Will Durant's _Story of Philosophy_, which goes through about a dozen big names in the western canon of philosophy.
3. I'm planning to follow [Susan Rigetti's guide](https://www.susanrigetti.com/philosophy) to flesh out my understanding.

Philosophy comes down to [[reading]] a lot of the time. How can we read philosophy well?

Ellie Anderson's [advice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pj26s8u6Vo) is to learn from somebody who has expertise. Take a course with an expert or join a reading group. Use vetted resources like Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy and Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy.

1. Skim and slog. Skim a portion of the text, then go back and closely read it. 
2. Annotate your text after finishing the section. After a reading session, take some notes about what you read in a notebook or app. 
3. Watch out for the logical moves that are being made. How is the author moving from one point to the next? Look out for errors or fallacies, and how much it matters.
4. Resist your first -- and second -- urge to reading.
5. Don't check your phone. Start with 25 minute reading sessions.
6. Learn to swim, to figure out the flow of a given philosopher. 

Other advice:

* Read with a pen or pencil
* Use sticky notes and annotations. Write marginalia.
* Export notes to notecards.
* Hold off on doing anything with the notecards until you're finished with the book.

* Don't remember. Understand.
* Figure out which claims support which other claims.
* Look for signposts.
* Make abstractions concrete.
* Try to disprove it.
* Read it again.
