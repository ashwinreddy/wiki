> The term proof originated in the practice of testing alcohol by wetting gunpow- der with it, and then applying a match to the powder. If the liquor were more than about 50 percent water, the powder would not go off. If the powder did go off, it was "proof" (or poof!) that the stuff was at least half alcohol (actually, 57 percent, but in the United States 100 proof is defined as 50 percent alcohol by volume).
