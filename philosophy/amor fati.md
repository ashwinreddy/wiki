## quotes


> Instead of wishing that things would happen as you'd like, wish that they would happen as they do, and then you'll be content. (_Enchiridion_ 8)

> My formula for greatness in a human being is _amor fati_: that one wants nothing to be different, not forward, not backward, not in all eternity. Not merely bear what is necessary, still less conceal it — all idealism is mendacity in the face of what is necessary — but _love_ it. -- ("Why I Am So Clever" 10)

> I want to learn more and more to see as beautiful what is necessary in things; then I shall be one of those who makes things beautiful. _Amor fati_: let that be my love henceforth! I do not want to wage war against what is ugly. I do not want to accuse; I do not even want to accuse those who accuse. _Looking away_ shall be my only negation. And all in all and on the whole: some day I wish to be only a Yes-sayer.
