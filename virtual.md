[[deleuze]] uses an actual-virtual distinction rather than real-possible. Deleuze thinks possible is a bad [[concept]] because it presupposes everything real is possible and can't explain why the possible hasn't come into being.[^source] The virtual is potential, e.g. the genotype compared to the phenotype.
