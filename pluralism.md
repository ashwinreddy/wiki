pluralism, as opposed to dualism or monism, means there are many substances or ways of being, etc.

[[deleuze]] writes about it in [[nietzsche and philosophy]]:

> and, in fact, pluralism (otherwise known as [[empiricism]]) is almost indistinguishable from [[philosophy]] itself. pluralism is the properly philosophical way of thinking, the one invented by philosophy; the only guarantor of freedom in the concrete spirit, the only principle of a violent atheism. 


[[hegel]] is opposed to pluralism.
