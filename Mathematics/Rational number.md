A **rational number** is the ratio of a numerator [[integer]] and a non-zero denominator integer. The [[set]] of rational numbers we denote $\mathbb{Q}$.

The rationals are dense in the reals, meaning for any two real numbers you pick you can always find a rational between them.

$$
(\forall a, b \in \RR )(a < b \implies \exists q \in \mathbb{Q} \text{ s.t. } a < q < b)
