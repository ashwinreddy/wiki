The **cross product** is a binary operation that's only really available in $\RR^3$ that generates an orthogonal pseudovector whose length is the area spanned by its operands.

\begin{equation}
\vec{a}\times\vec{b} = (\lVert \vec{a} \rVert \lVert \vec{b} \rVert \sin\theta)\cdot\hat{n}
\end{equation}

There is some ambiguity here because there are two orthogonal versions, we pick the one based on the right-hand rule.

# Computation

\begin{equation}
\vec{a}\times\vec{b} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{\hat{\imath}} & \hat{\jmath} & \hat{k} \\\\\ a_1 & a_2 & a_3 \\\\\ b_1 & b_2 & b_3 \end{vmatrix}
\end{equation}

# Pseudovector

Under a reflection, the cross product gains a sign flip.
