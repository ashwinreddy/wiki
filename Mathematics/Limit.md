A **limit** gives the value of a quantity that may be undefined by considering what the values around it imply it to be.

$$
\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L
$$

To prove a limit for a sequence, we can use the $\epsilon-N$ definition. We pick an arbitrary $\epsilon > 0$ and show that there is an $N$ such that $n > N$ implies $| s_n - s | < \epsilon$.
