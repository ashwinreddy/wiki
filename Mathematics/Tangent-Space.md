As long as the space is smooth (as assumed in the formal definition of a manifold), the difference vector $\mathrm{d}\vec{x}$ between to infinitesimally close points may be defined. The set of all $\mathrm{d}\vec{x}$ defines the tangent space at x. By assigning a tangent vector to every spacetime point, we can recover the usual concept of a vector field.
