A **differential form**. Forms give a natural way to do multivariable calculus.

In the language of differential forms, $\mathrm{d} x$ generates a 1-form from the 0-form $f$.

A 0-form is a smooth scalar function.


A differential 1-form is a covector with bases $\mathrm{d} x^i$. A basic or elementary 1-form is one of the $\mathrm{d} x_i$. As a covector, it takes in a vector and produces a number.
