An **integral** represents a number of different ideas. 

* The indefinite integral or [[antiderivative]] $\int f$,
* The unsigned definite integral $\int_{[a, b]} f(x) \dd{x}$
* The signed definite integral $\int_a^b f(x) \dd{x}$


The simplest of these is the [[definite integral]], the sum of a continuous quantity. It is typically represented by the notation

\begin{equation}
\int_a^b f(x)\\,\dd{x}
\end{equation}

There is also the  when limits are not put on the integral.

\begin{equation}
\int f(x)\\,\dd{x}
\end{equation}

One question that comes up is the importance of the $\dd{x}$. In the language of differential forms, this notation is given more concrete meaning.
