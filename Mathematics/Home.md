**Mathematics** is the study of simple problems that can be solved through measurement and their abstractions. In other words, mathematics broadly seeks to guarantee solutions to problems. Naturally, the basic problems in mathematics must be explainable in precise terms or the whole enterprise loses its meaning. All the cards must be on the table.


Thus, rigorous mathematics is highly formal: terms are defined explicitly and rather abstractly. However, the benefit is that if one can convincingly prove facts about these systems, there is very little doubt that it is true. This makes mathematics a useful foundation for the hard sciences.
