**Mathematics** is the study of simple problems and their abstractions. 

A simple problem tends to be one that can be solved through measurement, though it does not have to be. The defining characteristic is that the problem is clearly defined, and one will know if they have arrived at a potential solution. 

The first step of the mathematician is to then extract the core players in a problem and contemplate the relationships between these players.

The abstraction mechanism then asks how one might make the problem harder, more interesting, or more general. Simple problems may appear in very different places like geometry or algebra, but the mathematical machine has shown us that these are all very intimately and intricately woven: the same ideas can be reused over and over in these abstractions.

Part of the challenge of mathematics is transmitting this precision, the effective persuasion of abstract ideas. This leads to the abstract ideal of an "elegant proof," which is one that can tap into intuition or linguistic simplicity. Computations are an integral part of mathematics, but they rarely expose abstractions.

One can do mathematics at varying levels of rigor and formality. Informal mathematics uses more intuition and examples while formal mathematics defines terms explicitly and abstractly. However, the benefit is that if one can convincingly prove facts about these systems, there is very little doubt that it is true. Because mathematics is self-contained and makes no references to outside concepts, a computer can verify or even potentially prove theorems; when a program exists to verify a proof, our uncertainty in the proof becomes practically infinitesimal. The generally low uncertainty in well-established ideas makes mathematics a useful foundation for the hard sciences.
