**Mathematics** is the study of simple problems and their abstractions. A simple problem tends to be one that can be solved through measurement, though it does not have to be. The idea is that the problem is clearly defined, and one will know if they have arrived at a solution.


In other words, mathematics broadly seeks to guarantee solutions to problems. Naturally, the basic problems in mathematics must be explainable in precise terms or the whole enterprise loses its meaning. All the cards must be on the table.

Part of the challenge of mathematics is transmitting this precision, the persuasion of abstract ideas.


Thus, rigorous mathematics is highly formal: terms are defined explicitly and rather abstractly. However, the benefit is that if one can convincingly prove facts about these systems, there is very little doubt that it is true. Because mathematics is self-contained and makes no references to outside concepts, a computer can verify or even potentially prove theorems; when a program exists to verify a proof, our uncertainty in the proof becomes practically infinitesimal. The generally low uncertainty in well-established ideas makes mathematics a useful foundation for the hard sciences.
