**Extrema** refer to **maxima** and **minima** of a set, potentially the range of a function.

# Real Analysis

Suppose $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is a non-empty [[subset]] of the [[real numbers|real number]]. We say $s_0$ is the maximum of $\forall s \in S, s \leq s_0$ and the minimum if $s \geq s_0$. Simply put, the maximum is the biggest element of the set and the minimum is the smallest element of the set.

If you want to show that a set has no maximum, it suffices to show $\forall x \in S$, $\exists y\in S$ such that $x < y$.

# Functions

As this [post](http://caseychu.io/posts/minimum-and-maximum-of-two-functions/) points out,

$$
\max\left(f(x), g(x)\right) = { f(x) + g(x) \over 2} + { | f(x)-g(x)| \over 2}
$$

$$
\min\left(f(x), g(x)\right) = { f(x) + g(x) \over 2} - { | f(x)-g(x)| \over 2}
$$
