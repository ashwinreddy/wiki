The **Chinese remainder theorem** is a very useful result in number theory that allows one to reconstruct an integer $x$ given enough of its remainders. In essence, we have a system of equations, each of the form

\begin{equation}
x \equiv a_1 \mod 
\end{equation}


The condition is that we have $k$ pairwise coprime integers; then, we will know $x$ up to modulo the product of those integers.
