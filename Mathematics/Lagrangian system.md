A **Lagrangian system**. 

> Let $M$ be a diff'able [[manifold]] with [[tangent bundle]] $TM$ and $L: TM \to \RR$ a diff'able function. A map $\gamma: \RR \to M$ is called a _motion in the lagrangian system with configuration manifold_ $M$ and lagrangian function $L$ if $\gamma$ is an extremal of the [[action]]
