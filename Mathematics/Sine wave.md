A **sine wave** or **sinusoid** is a wave. 


[[angular frequency]]

$$
y(t) = A \sin(\omega t + \phi)
$$

|Property|Value|

|Amplitude|$A$|
|[[Angular frequency]]|$\omega$|

The ordinary [[sine]] function completes a cycle with period $2\pi$, which means that in general the period is

$$
T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega}
$$
