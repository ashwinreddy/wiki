The critical concept of calculus is that a curve is made up of straight line segments if we zoom close enough. Manifolds generalize this concept with a topological space that locally resembles Euclidean space. 

Clearly, $\mathbb{R}^n$ is an _n_-dimensional manifold.


A chart is a homeomorphism that maps coordinate neighborhoods of points on an $n$-dimensional manifold to a subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$.

An [[atlas]] on a manifold is a set of charts whose domains cover the manifold completely.
