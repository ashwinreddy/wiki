# Topological Manifold

A [topological space](./Topology#topological-space) is called a $d$-dimensional topological manifold if 

\begin{equation}
\forall p \in M: \exists U \in p \in \mathcal{O}: \exists x: U \to x(U) \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d
\end{equation}
  
and $x$ is invertible and continous, and $x^{-1}$ is continuous.
