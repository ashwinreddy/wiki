The critical concept of calculus is that a curve is made up of straight line segments if we zoom close enough. Manifolds generalize this concept with a topological space that locally resembles Euclidean space. In other words, (as suggested by Spivak in Intro to Diff Geo):

> A manifold is supposed to be "locally" like one of these exemplary metric spaces $\mathbb{R}^n$. To be precise, a manifold is a metric space $M$ with the following property: If $x \in M$, then there is some neighborhood $U$ of $x$ and some whole number $n$ such that $U$ is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$.

Examples:

- Clearly, $\mathbb{R}^n$ is an _n_-dimensional manifold.
- An _n_-sphere
- An _n_-torus
- Direct product of two manifolds


A chart is a [[homeomorphism]] that maps coordinate neighborhoods of points on an $n$-dimensional manifold to a subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$.

An [[atlas]] on a manifold is a set of charts whose domains cover the manifold completely.
