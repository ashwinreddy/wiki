A **bundle** is a triple $\pi: E \to M$. _E_ is a smooth manifold called total space. $\pi$ is a surjective, smooth map. $M$ is a smooth manifold.

The fiber over $p \in M$ is the preimage of $p$ from $\pi$.

A section $\sigma$ of a bundle goes from $M$ to $E$ such that $\pi \circ \sigma = \mathrm{id}_M$
