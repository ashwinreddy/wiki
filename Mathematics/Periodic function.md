A **periodic function** is a [[function]] that repeats itself periodically. A [[sine wave]] is a prototypical example. If the length of period is $T$ then for any $x$,

$$
\forall x: f(x + T) = f(x).
$$

The smallest such $T$ is the **fundamental period**. Therefore, one only needs to know the values in any arbitrary interval of the fundamental period's length to know the function fully. 


Every function is periodic if we allow a period of infinite width.
