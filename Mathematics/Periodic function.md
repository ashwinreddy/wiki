A **periodic function** is a [[function]] that continually repeats itself over an interval of fixed length $T$. If the length of period is $T$ then for any $x$,

$$
\forall t: x(t + T) = x(t).
$$

The smallest such $T$ is the **fundamental period**. Then, the **fundamental frequency** $f$ is the reciprocal. 

$$
fT \equiv 1.
$$


A [[sine wave]] is a prototypical example, but every function is periodic if we allow a period of infinite width.

Fourier's big discovery is the following:

> No matter how complicated it is, a wave that is periodic - with a pattern that repeats itself - consists of the sum of many simple waves.
