A **periodic function** is a [[function]] that continually repeats itself over an interval of fixed length $T$. If the length of period is $T$ then for any $x$,

$$
\forall t: x(t + T) = x(t).
$$

The smallest such $T$ is the **fundamental period**. Then, the fundamental frequency is the reciprocal. 


A [[sine wave]] is a prototypical example, but every function is periodic if we allow a period of infinite width.
