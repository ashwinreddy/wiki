A **periodic function** is a [[function]] that repeats itself periodically. If the length of period is $T$ then for any $x$,

$$
\forall x: f(x + T) = f(x).
$$

Therefore, one only needs to know the values in any arbitrary interval of length $T$ to know the function fully. A [[sine wave]] is a prototypical example.
