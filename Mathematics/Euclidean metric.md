The **Euclidean metric** is the [[p-norm]] with $p=2$, extending [[Pythagorean theorem]] to higher dimensions.

$$
d(x, y) \triangleq \sqrt{(x_1 - y_1)^2 + \dots + (x_n -y_n)^2}
$$

As a metric, tensor we simply notice it as the [[identity matrix]] and write the [[Kronecker delta]].

$$
g_{ij} = \delta_{ij}
$$
