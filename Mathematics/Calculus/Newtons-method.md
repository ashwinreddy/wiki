Recall that the best linear approximation for $f(x)$ at $x_0$ is

\begin{equation}
y = f'(x_0)(x-x_0)+f(x_0)
\end{equation}

Well, if we're looking for roots of $f(x)$, we could imagine looking to our linear model to see where the root is (what $x$ value corresponds to the 0):

\begin{gather}
0 = f'(x_0)(x-x_0)+f(x_0) \\
x_0 + \frac{-f(x_0)}{f'(x_0)} = x
\end{gather}
