# Introduction

## Definitions
\begin{equation}
\vec{T}(t) = \hat{\dot{r}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\vec{N}(t) = \hat{\dot{T}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\vec{B}(t) = \vec{T}(t)\times\vec{N}(t)
\end{equation}

## Application to Motion

\begin{equation}
\vec{a} = v' \vec{T} + \kappa v^2 \vec{N}
\end{equation}

This equation informs us that motion has two components: a linear and radial component. The linear component is responsible for tangent lines that we're used to thinking about, but the radial component is slightly more complex. Recall that $\kappa ~ \frac{1}{r} $ The acceleration in the radial component seems to be

\begin{equation}
a_r = \frac{v^2}{r}
\end{equation}
