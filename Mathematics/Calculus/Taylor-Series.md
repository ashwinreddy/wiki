The **Taylor series** provides a polynomial approximation to a function that becomes arbitrarily good with more terms. The expansion for a generic function $f(x)$ at a point $a$ is

\\[
\sum_{n=0}^\infty \left(\frac{D^n f(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n\right)
\\]

To first-order,

\\[
f(x_0+\Delta x) \approx f(x_0) +f'(x_0)\Delta x
\\]
