The **chain rule** is an important rule in calculus that tells you how to take the [[derivative]] when you have function composition. Formally,

\begin{equation}
(f \circ g)\'(x) = (f' \circ g)(x) \cdot g'(x)
\end{equation}

Heuristically,

\begin{equation}
\dv{y}{x} = \dv{y}{u}\cdot\dv{u}{x}
\end{equation}
