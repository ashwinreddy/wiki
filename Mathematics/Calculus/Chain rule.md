The **chain rule** is an important rule in calculus that tells you how to take derivatives when you compose functions. Formally,

\begin{equation}
(f \circ g)'(x) = (f' \circ g)(x) \cdot g'(x) \tag{Chain Rule}
\end{equation}

Heuristically,

\begin{equation}
\dv{y}{x} = \dv{y}{u} \dv{u}{x}
\end{equation}
