**Integration by parts** is a technique for computing an [[integral]] using the product rule in reverse.

$$
\int u(x) v'(x) \dd{x} = u(x)v(x) - \int u'(x) v(x) \dd{x}
$$

$$
uv = \int u \\, \dd{v} + \int v \\, \dd{u} \tag{Product Rule}
$$



# Quantum Mechanics

In quantum mechanics, we often have $f, g \to 0$ at the boundary, so

$$
\int f \dv{g}{x} \dd{x} = - \int \dv{f}{x} g \dd{x}
$$
