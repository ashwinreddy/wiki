**Integration by parts** is a technique for computing an [[integral]] using the product rule in reverse.

$$
uv = \int u \\, \dd{v} + \int v \\, \dd{u}
$$

Then, if you have a complicated integral, the actual technique is

$$
\int u \\, \dd{v}  = uv - \int v \\, \dd{u} 
$$

Of course, the technique can be adapted to include limits.

$$
\int_a^b u \\, \dd{v}  = \left[uv\right]_a^b - \int_a^b v \\, \dd{u} 
$$
