Field: set on which addition, subtraction, multiplication, division are defined

Examples: rational numbers, real numbers, complex numbers

Vectors: 

vector space can be generated from a field. For example, you could have vector space $\mathbb{C}^3$ for 3 complex numbers.

vector space is commutative under addition.

The algebra of a field is a vector space equipped with a bilinear product. Examples are inner product and cross product.
