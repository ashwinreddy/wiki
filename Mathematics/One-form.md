A **one-form** is a [[linear map]] that we could take to be $\omega: T_p M \to \RR$. Such a function would take an element of the [[tangent space]] of the [[manifold]] $M$ and send it to the [[reals|real number]], making it an element of the [[cotangent space]]. For example suppose we're in [[Euclidean space]] $M = \RR^2$. Then the generic one-form $\omega$ would look like

$$
\omega(\langle \dd{x}, \dd{y} \rangle ) = a\\, \dd{x} + b \\, \dd{y} = \langle a, b \rangle \cdot \langle \dd{x}, \dd{y} \rangle
$$

You can take products of one-forms using the [[wedge product]].
