The **exterior derivative** gives a concrete meaning to the $\dd{}$ notation from calculus. It promotes a $k$-form on a manifold $M$ to a $k+1$-form.


\begin{equation}
\dd{}: \Omega^k(M) \to \Omega^{k+1}(M)
\end{equation}

For example, if $f$ is a 0-form, meaning a smooth function, then $\dd{f}$ is the linear functional given by the [[directional derivative]] of $f$ (in the direction given by its input).

\begin{equation}
\dd{f}(x) = \partial_{x}f
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\dd{}^2  \equiv 0
\end{equation}

# Types

Closed form
: An $n$-form $\omega$ is closed if $\dd{\omega} = 0$.

Exact form
: An $n$-form $\omega$ is exact if $\omega = \dd{\eta}$ for some $\eta$
