A **homomorphism** is a map between two algebraic structures of the same type that respects the operations of the structures. Formally, a map $f: A \to B$ preserves an operation $\mu$ of arity $k$, defined on both $A$ and $B$ if

\\[
f(\mu_A(a_1, \dots, a_k)) = \mu_B(f(a_1, \dots, a_k))
\\]

Example:

$x \mapsto e^x \in \mathrm{Hom}(\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{R}^+)$
