The **quotient group** $G/N$ for a [[group]] $G$ with [[normal subgroup]] $N$ is a group made up of the left [[coset]]s of $N$ with the product defined in the following way:

* The product of cosets $C_1$ and $C_2$ in $G/N$ is the coset corresponding to $q_1q_2$ where $q_1$ is the value associated with $C_1$ and $q_2$ for $C_2$.
