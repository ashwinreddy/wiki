A **group** is a [[set]] $G$ equipped with an invertible, associative binary operation $(\cdot): G \times G \to G$. The operation can be treated as addition or multiplication based on context.

# Properties

* The map $x \mapsto gx$ for $g \in G$ is a [[bijection]].

# Operation

Explicitly, the operation needs to satisfy

Closure
: $ a, b \in G \implies a\cdot b \in G$

Identity existence
: There is an element $I \in G$ such that $\forall a \in G, I \cdot a= a \cdot I = a$

Invertibility
: Every $a$ has a friend $a^{-1}$ so that $a^{-1}\cdot a = a \cdot a^{-1} = I$

Associativity
: $a(bc)=(ab)c$

An **abelian group** is one for which $ab=ba$. A **subgroup** for $G$ is a [[subset]] $H$ that satisfies the above given the same operation $(\cdot)$.

The order of a group is just the size of its underlying set.

# Examples

- $(\mathbb{Z}, +)$
- $(\mathbb{Q}\setminus \\{0\\}, \times)$
- Rotations in 3D space
- Complex numbers $z$ with $z\bar{z}=1$ with multiplication
- Addition of real numbers
- Addition of even integers (odd integers would not work)
