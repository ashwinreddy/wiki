A **group homomorphism** is a [[function]] between [[groups|group]] that preserves structure. It is a $f: G\to H$ for [[group]]s $G$ and $H$ such that $f(g_1g_2)=f(g_1)f(g_2)$. 

Trivial homomorphism
: The homomorphism that sends everything to the identity element in $H$.

A homomorphism can be shown diagramatically with a [[short exact sequence]]

\begin{equation}
0 \to \operatorname{ker}f \to G \to \operatorname{im}f \to 0
\end{equation}
