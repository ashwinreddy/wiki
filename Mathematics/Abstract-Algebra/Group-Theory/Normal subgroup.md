A **normal subgroup** of a [[group]] $G$ is a [[subgroup]] $N \triangleleft G$ if

* it is the [[group kernel]] of some homomorphism,
* or, equivalently, the conjugation $n \mapsto g^{-1} n g$ by any element $g \in G$ leaves the element inside the group $N$



Every group is a normal subgroup of itself.
