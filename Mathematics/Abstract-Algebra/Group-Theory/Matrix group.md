A **matrix group** is a [[group]] of [[invertible matrices|invertible matrix]] [^intuition].

[^intuition]: If you want to put in $A$ and $B$, you must also put in $AB$, $A^{-1}$, and $B^{-1}$.

The **tangent space** to a matrix group at the identity is a subspace of the vector space of matrices. It has dimension $\dim G$.


$$
T_G = \left\{ \gamma'(0) | \gamma : (-\epsilon, \epsilon) \to G \text{ differentiable curve with } \gamma(0) = I\right\}
$$
