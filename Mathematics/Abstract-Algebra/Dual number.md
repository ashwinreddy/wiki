**Dual numbers** are an extension of the [[real numbers|real number]] of the form $a + b \epsilon$ where $\epsilon$ such that $\epsilon^2 = 0$. Practically, we can represent it using matrices:

\begin{equation}
\epsilon = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

# Abstract construction

We can also describe dual numbers as the [[quotient ring]] of the [[polynomial ring]] $R[X]$ divided by the ideal $X^2$.
