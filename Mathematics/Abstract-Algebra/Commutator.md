The **commutator** is a [[binary operation]] that measures failure of [[commutativity|commutative property]] for a given binary operation by comparing the results in both orders.

\begin{equation}
[a, b] \triangleq ab - ba
\end{equation}

A [[commutative function|commutative property]] will have a commutator identically 0.
