A **normed division algebra** is a [[division algebra]][^nna] with submultiplicative norm. It turns out by Hurwitz's theorem that there are only four such algebras:

* the [[real numbers|real number]]
* the [[complex numbers|complex number]]
* the [[quaternions|quaternion]]

[^nna]: Doesn't have to be associative.
