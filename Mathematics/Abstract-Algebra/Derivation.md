A **derivation** is a [[linear map]] on an [[algebra over a field]] that shares properties with the derivative.

\begin{equation}
d(ab) = d(a)b + ad(b) \tag{Leibniz Rule}
\end{equation}

The [[commutator]] of derivations is itself a derivation, which makes it a [[Lie algebra]] with the commutator as its [[Lie bracket]].
