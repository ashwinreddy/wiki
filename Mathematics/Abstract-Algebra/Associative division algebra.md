An **associative division algebra** is an [[associative algebra]] and a [[division algebra]]. The best-known examples are finite-dimensional ones because the Frobenius theorem says there are only 3 such algebras:

* The [[reals|real numbers]]
* The [[complex numbers|complex number]]
* The [[quaternions|quaternion]]
