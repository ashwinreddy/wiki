An **ideal** is a [[subset]] of a [[ring]] $R$ if it is an additive [[subgroup]] that absorbs multiplication by elements of $R$.

Two-sided ideal
: An ideal that works for both left and right multiplication.

Zero ideal
: The ideal consisting of just the additive identity. Every ideal contains it.

# Examples


* The even integers are an ideal for the ring $\mathbb{Z}$ because adding even numbers is closed in addition and multiplication.
