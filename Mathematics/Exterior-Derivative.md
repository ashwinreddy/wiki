The exterior derivative of a [[differential form]] of degree _k_ is a differential form of degree _k+1_

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{d}f = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}\mathrm{d}x_i = \vec\nabla f \cdot d\vec{r}
\end{equation}

let f be a function and $\alpha$ a form just involving dx, dy, dz, and $\wedge$
\\[
d(f\alpha) = df \wedge \alpha
\\]

It may be helpful to view $\mathrm{d}\omega$ as $\mathrm{d}\wedge\omega$.

The operator is also nilpotent, that is,

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{d}(\mathrm{d}f)=0
\end{equation}

This is usually summarized succinctly (although somewhat ambiguously) with

\\[
d^2 = 0
\\]
