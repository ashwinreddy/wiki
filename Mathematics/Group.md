A **group** is a [[set]] with an associative, invertible binary operation.


is an abstraction in mathematics that applies to many objects. Naturally, this makes it hard to describe without resorting to the formal definition. However, proofs about groups are powerful _because_ they apply to lots of objects. 

A group is just a set $(G, \star)$ with a binary operation $\star$ that obeys a few properties.

Closure
: The $\star$ of two elements needs to belong to the group

Associativity
: Order of operation should not matter

Identity element
: There must be an element that does nothing when applied from either side

Inverse element
: Every element needs a friend such that their multiplication from either side is the identity
