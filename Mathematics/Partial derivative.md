The **partial derivative** of a function tells you the derivative when you nudge an input, _ceteris paribus_. A partial derivative on its own doesn't tell you very much, so you usually want a little more structure:

* a partial differential equation
* a gradient

\begin{equation}
\pdv{f}{x_i} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{}{h}
\end{equation}
