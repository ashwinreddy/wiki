A **sequence** is an ordered list of objects. 

A common case is a sequence $s_n$ of real numbers. Here, we typically want to know if a sequence will converge, i.e. if it has a limit.

* Every convergent sequence is bounded.
* An increasing function has limit $\infty$ if it is not bounded above but converges if it is bounded above.

# Monotone sequence

A monotone sequence is one that is either increasing like $s_n \leq s_{n+1}$ or decreasing like $s_n \geq s_{n+1}$.
