A **subsequence** of a [[sequence]] is a sequence $\left(s_{n_k}\right)$ that selects out elements from the sequence and preserves their order. A subsequence will converge to $s$, if the original sequence $s_n$ converges to $s$.

Every subsequence provides a subsequential limit for the original sequence.
