For a [[curve]], arclength is

\begin{align}
s: I &\to \mathbb{R} \\\
t &\mapsto \int_{t_0}^t |\alpha'(u)|du
\end{align}

This is not a [[diffeomorphism]]. If we have a regular curve, and we look at $J = s(I)$ and define a $\beta(s) = \alpha \circ s^{-1}$, $J \to \mathbb{R}^3$, then $\forall s \in J, \lvert\beta'(s)\rvert=1 $

Every regular curve can be parameterized with arc length. It's not a unique parameterization. It depends on a fixed point and a constant of integration.

Example: Line

\\[
\alpha(t) = \vec{v}t + \vec{v}_0
\\]
