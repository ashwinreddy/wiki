The **rank-nullity theorem** says that for a [[linear map]] $T: V \to W$, every dimension is either filled or not. By the pigenhole principle, we can simply say that the sum of [[rank]] and nullity is appropriate:

\begin{equation}
\operatorname{rank} T + \dim \ker T = \operatorname{dim} V
\end{equation}
