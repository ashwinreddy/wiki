Two matrices $A$ and $B$ are **similar** if they represent the same linear map in two (possibly different) bases. That is, there exists a [[change of basis]] $P$ such that

$$
B = P^{-1}AP
$$

In other words, the action $B$ performs is nothing but changing bases, applying $A$, and then changing back.
