**Matrix similarity** is an [[equivalence relation]] for [[square matrices|square matrix]]: $A$ and $B$ are similar if there is an [[invertible matrix]] $P$ such that

\begin{equation}
B=P^{-1}AP
\end{equation}

Similar matrices have the same eigenvalues. Suppose $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue for $A$, meaning $Ax = \lambda x$.
