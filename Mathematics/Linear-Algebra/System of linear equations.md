A **system of linear equations** is a collection of equations over the same set of variables. It can be represented using

$$
A\vec{x}=\vec{b}
$$

Notice that there are family of solutions: for any $\vec{x}$ that works, we find that $\vec{x} + N\vec{z}$ is also a solution for arbitrary vector $\vec{z}$ with $N$ the null space of $A$.
