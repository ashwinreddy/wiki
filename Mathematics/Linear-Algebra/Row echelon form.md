**Row echelon form** is a particular configuration of a [[matrix]] in which

1. All nonzero rows are above all zero rows
2. The leading entries of a non-zero row is always to the right of the leading entries of the row above it.
3. All leading entries of non-zero rows are equal to 1.

Reduced row echelon form
: A row echelon form matrix where each leading entry of a nonzero row is the only nonzero entry in its column
