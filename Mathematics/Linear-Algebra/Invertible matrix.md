An **invertible matrix** is a [[square matrix]] $A$ whose operation can be "undone", that is we can find an $A^{-1}$ such that

\begin{equation}
AA\^{-1}=A\^{-1}A = I
\end{equation}

An invertible matrix must then be one that loses no information, which can happen if columns/rows are linearly dependent. If a matrix is not invertible, it is singular. There are no other options.

An operational definition for an invertible matrix is one whose [[determinant]] is nonzero.

# Properties

* The inverse, if it exists, is unique.
* A left inverse is a right inverse and vice versa.
