An **invertible matrix** is a [[square matrix]] $A$ whose operation can be "undone", that is we can find an $A^{-1}$ such that

\begin{equation}
AA\^{-1}=A\^{-1}A = I
\end{equation}

An invertible matrix must then be one that loses no information, which can happen if columns/rows are linearly dependent.
