A **matrix** is just a collection of objects, typically numbers, organized in a grid of rows and columns. When we say an $m \times n$ matrix, we mean $n$ rows and $m$ columns. It is also useful to imagine a matrix as holding $n$ row vectors or $m$ column vectors.

What makes matrices useful is [[matrix multiplication]].



Square matrix
: An $n \times n$ matrix

Orthogonal matrix
: A square matrix with orthonormal rows/columns
