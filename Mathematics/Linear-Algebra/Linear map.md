A **linear map / function / operator / transformation** is a [[function]] $f: V \to W$ for [[vector spaces|vector space]] $V$ and $W$ that respects a [[linear combination]], which means

$$
f(\alpha v) = \alpha f(v)
$$

$$
f(v_1+v_2) = f(v_1) + f(v_2)
$$

At least in the finite case, it can be represented by a [[matrix]] of coefficients.
