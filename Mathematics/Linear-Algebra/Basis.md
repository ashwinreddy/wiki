A **basis** $\mathcal{B}$ for a [[vector space]] is a minimal [[set]] of [[vectors|vector]] $\left\\{ \vec{b}\right\\}_{i=1}^n$ needed to [[span]] the entirety of the space. A basis need not be unique, but every basis will have the same number of elements $n$, which defines the [[dimension]] of the vector space.

\begin{equation}
\dim V \triangleq | \mathcal{B} |
\end{equation}


In other words, any $\vec{v} \in V$ can be written with appropriate choice of $\alpha_i$

\begin{equation}
\vec{v} = \sum_{i=1}^{\dim V} \alpha_i \vec{b}_i
\end{equation}

# Change of basis

One can choose to move to a different basis with total impunity because every basis has the same dimension and is invertible as a matrix.
