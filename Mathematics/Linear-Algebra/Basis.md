A **basis** $\mathcal{B}$ for a [[vector space]] is a minimal set of elements $\\{b_i\\}$ needed to express the entirety of the space (using linear combinations). 


Every basis will have the same number of elements $n$, which defines the dimension of the vector space.

\begin{equation}
\dim V \triangleq | \mathcal{B} |
