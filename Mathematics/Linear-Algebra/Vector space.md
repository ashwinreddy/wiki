A **vector space** over a [[field]] $F$ is a [[set]] $V$ equipped with scalar multiplication $(\cdot): F \times V \to V$ and vector addition $+: V \times V \to V$.




# Examples

* Any field $F$ on its own can be a vector space
* Functions
* $\RR^n$
* Matrices

# Consequences

* All vector spaces of dimension $n$ are isomorphic to one another.
