A **vector space** over a [[field]] $F$ is a [[set]] $V$ equipped with scalar multiplication $(\cdot): F \times V \to V$ and vector addition $+: V \times V \to V$ that obey some nice properties. The existence of these two operations allows us to take weighted sums of vectors, known as linear combinations. 

Examples:

* Any field $F$ on its own can be a vector space
* Functions
* $\RR^n$
* Matrices
