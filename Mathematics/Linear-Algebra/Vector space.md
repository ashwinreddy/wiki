A vector space is a set $V$ equipped with scalar multiplication $(\cdot): F \times V \to V$ for a field $F$ and vector addition $+: V \times V \to V$ that obey some nice properties. The existence of these two operations allows us to take weighted sums of vectors, known as linear combinations. Examples of vector spaces include functions, $\RR^n$, and matrices.
