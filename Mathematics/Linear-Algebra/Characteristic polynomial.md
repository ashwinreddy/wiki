The **characteristic polynomial** of a [[square matrix]] $A$, which we'll say is $n \times n$, is an $n$th degree [[polynomial]] of a parameter $\lambda$ given by

\begin{equation}
p(\lambda) = \det(A - \lambda I).
\end{equation}

# Characteristic equation

The characteristic equation is simply $p(\lambda)=0$, the roots of which indicate [[eigenvalues|eigenpairs]].
