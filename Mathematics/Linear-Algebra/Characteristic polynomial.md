The **characteristic polynomial** of a [[square matrix]] matrix $A$ of order $n$ is an $n$-th degree polynomial of a parameter $\lambda$ given by

\begin{equation}
p(\lambda) \doteq \det(A - \lambda I).
\end{equation}

# Characteristic equation

The characteristic equation is simply $p(\lambda)=0$, the roots of which indicate eigenvalues.
