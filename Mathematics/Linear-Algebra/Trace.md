The **trace** of a [[matrix]] is the sum of its diagonal and happens to be the sum of [[eigenvalues|eigenpairs]].

\begin{equation}
\operatorname{tr}(A) = \sum_{i=1}^{d} A_{ii} = \sum_i \lambda_i
\end{equation}

The trace is invariant under cyclic permutations.


Suppose you have an [[orthonormal basis]] $(\varphi_n)_n$. Then the trace is

$$
\operatorname{tr} K = \sum_n \langle \varphi_n , K \varphi_n \rangle
$$
