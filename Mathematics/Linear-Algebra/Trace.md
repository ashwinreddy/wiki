The **trace** of a [[matrix]] is the sum of its diagonal and happens to be the sum of [[eigenvalues|eigenpairs]].

\begin{equation}
\operatorname{Tr}(A) = \sum_{i} A_{ii} = \sum_i \lambda_i
\end{equation}

The trace is invariant under cyclic permutations.


Suppose you have an [[orthonormal basis]] $(\varphi_n)_n$. Then the trace is
