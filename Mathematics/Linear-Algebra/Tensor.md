An $(r, s)$ tensor $T$ over a vector space $V$ is a multilinear map

\begin{equation}
T: \underbrace{V^\* \times \dots \times V^\*}\_{r \text{ copies}} \times \underbrace{V \times \dots \times V}_{s\text{ copies}} \to \mathbb{R}
\end{equation}

Clearly, the vector space $V$ itself is the special case of a $(0, 1)$ tensor and the [[dual space]] likewise for $(1,0)$. It  may not be obvious, but there is a corrsepondence between $(1,1)$ tensors and [[linear map]]s.

If we wanted to write out the components of a tensor, we would have $(r+s)^{\dim V}$ components given by

$$
T^{i_1\dots i_r}_{j_1 \dots j_s}
$$
