**Linear algebra** is the study of lines. One may wonder why an entire field of study is dedicated to lines. This is because of a few reasons:

* lines can be applied to many situations directly
* when lines cannot be directly applied, they can offer a good first-order approximation
* lines are fairly easy to reason, intuit, and draw
* but lines can exist in any number of dimensions
