**Linear algebra** is the study of lines. One may wonder why an entire field of study is dedicated to lines. Lines are simple to understand, in 1, 2, 3, and even higher dimensions but are not entirely trivial. A good problem solving tip is to simplify problems as much as possible, and lines are thus a good first choice.
