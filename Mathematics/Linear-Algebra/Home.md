**Linear algebra** is the study of lines. One may wonder why an entire field of study is dedicated to lines. Lines are simple to understand, in 1, 2, 3, and even higher dimensions but capture enough complexity to be interesting. A good problem solving tip is to simplify problems as much as possible, and lines are thus a good first choice. 

Typical linear algebra classes start by describing how to solve a system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination. It then becomes useful to introduce notions of matrices and vectors, etc. These later become formally codified using the idea of a [[vector space]].
