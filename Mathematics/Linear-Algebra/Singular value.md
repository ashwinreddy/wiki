A **singular value** of an operator $T: X \to Y$ is a square root of the [[eigenvalue|eigenpairs]] of the operator $T^* T$ where $T*$ is the [[Hermitian adjoint]].

In pedestrian language for linear algebra, if we have a matrix $A$, it is $\sqrt{\lambda}$ for $\lambda$ eigenvalue of $A^\mathsf{T}A$. Note that it is possible for the singular values to coincide with the eigenvalues! For example, the singular values and eigenvalues of $X^\mathsf{T}X$ are the same for arbitrary $X$.
