The **rank** of a [[matrix]] is the dimension of its [[range]], a count of the number of [[linearly independent|Linear dependence]] elements.

\begin{equation}
\operatorname{rank} A \doteq \dim \mathcal{R}(A)
\end{equation}

An $m \times n$ matrix would have

\begin{equation}
\operatorname{rank} A \leq \min(m, n)
\end{equation}
