A **dual pair** is a $(X, Y, \langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle)$ for [[vector space]]s $X$ and $Y$ over the same field $F$ with a duality pairing $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle: X \times Y \to F$ that is said to put $X$ and $Y$ in duality.

We can easily put $V$ and its [[dual space]] $V^*$ into duality with a natural pairing. Since any element of the dual vector knows how to eat a vector and produce an element of $F$, we just pair them up:

\begin{align\*}
\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle: V^* \times V &\to F \\\\\
(\varphi, \vec{x}) &\mapsto \varphi(\vec{x})
\end{align\*}
