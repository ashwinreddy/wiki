The **eigendecomposition** of a [[matrix]] $A$ is a [[matrix decomposition]] that yields an **eigenbasis** with [[eigenpairs]]. If $\Lambda$ is a [[diagonal matrix]] with the eigenvalues and $Q$ has the corresponding eigenvectors, we could write

$$
AQ = Q\Lambda \iff A = Q\Lambda Q^{-1}
$$

If $A$ is a [[symmetric matrix]], then $Q$ is [[orthogonal matrix]].
