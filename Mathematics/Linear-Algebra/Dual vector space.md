The **dual vector space** for a [[vector space]] $V$ over a field $k$ is just $\operatorname{Hom}(V, k)$ seen as a vector space, denoted $V^\*$. A choice of [[basis]] $\left\\{\vec{e}\_i\right\\}\_{i \in I}$ for $V$ induces a basis for $V^*$. The elements of the dual vector space are called **dual vectors**, **covectors**, or **one forms**.

# Involution

For a finite dimensional vector space, $V^** \cong V$.
