The **dual vector space** for a [[vector space]] $V$ over a field $k$ is just $\hom(V, k)$ seen as a vector space, denoted $V^\*$. Its elements are [[linear forms|linear form]].

For a finite dimensional vector space, the operation of taking a dual vector is an [[involution]]. In other words, the claim is that the double dual $V^{\*\*}$ corresponds to $V$. To see this, consider how you would map $f(\vec{x})$ to a number. You would simply feed it a vector! You can do this for any vector in $V$, so $V^{**}$ reconstructs $V$ exactly through this technical bridge.
