The **dual vector space** for a [[vector space]] $V$ over a field $k$ is just $\operatorname{Hom}(V, k)$ seen as a vector space, denoted $V^\*$. The elements of the dual vector space are called **dual vectors**, **covectors**, or **one forms**. In standard linear algebra, such a dual vector could be compactly represented by a constant vector $\vec{a}$.

$$
f(\vec{x}) = \vec{a}^T \vec{x}
$$

A choice of [[basis]] $\left\\{\vec{e}\_i\right\\}\_{i \in I}$ for $V$ induces a basis for $V^*$.

For a finite dimensional vector space, the operation of taking a dual vector is an [[involution]]. In other words, the claim is that the double dual $V^{\*\*}$ corresponds to $V$. To see this, consider how you would map $f(\vec{x})$ to a number. You would simply feed it a vector! You can do this for any vector in $V$, so $V^{**}$ reconstructs $V$ exactly through this technical bridge.
