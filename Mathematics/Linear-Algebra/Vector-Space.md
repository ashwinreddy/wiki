A **vector space** is a set equipped with vector addition and scalar multiplication. Vectors in the space can be written as a linear combination of basis vectors so long as those vectors are linearly independent.


Functions are vectors.

# Vector Operations

Vectors can be equipped with operations.

## Dot Product

The **dot product** returns a linear combination between two vectors. In an orthonormal system,

$$
\vec{a}\cdot\vec{b}=\sum_{i=1}^3 a_ib_i
$$

In two-dimensions

$$
\vec{a}\cdot\vec{b} = ab\cos\theta
$$

For tensors,

$$
\vec{a}\cdot\vec{b} = g_{ij}a^ib^j
$$
