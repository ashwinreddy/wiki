A **rotation matrix** is just another name for an [[orthogonal matrix]], usually in the context of computing the components of a vector after rotation. In 2D a counterclockwise rotation through $\theta$ is represented by

$$
R(\theta) = \begin{pmatrix}\cos\theta & -\sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & \cos\theta\end{pmatrix}
$$
