A **diagonal matrix** is a [[matrix]] that has only nonzero elements on the diagonal. If we are going to construct a diagonal matrix, we might write

$$
D = \operatorname{diag}(d_1, \dots, d_n)
$$

# Properties

* The [[eigenvalues|eigenpairs]] of a diagonal matrix are given by the elements on the diagonal.
