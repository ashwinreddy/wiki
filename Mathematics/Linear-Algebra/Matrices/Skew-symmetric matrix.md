A **skew-symmetric matrix** is a [[square matrix]] $A$ such that

\begin{equation}
\boxed{A^\top = - A}
\end{equation}

Skew-symmetric matrices make up the [[Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{so}(n)$ for the [[special orthogonal group]] $SO(n)$.

# Properties

* A skew-symmetric matrix has a diagonal of zeros. Therefore, its [[trace]] is zero.
