A **skew-symmetric matrix** is a [[square matrix]] $A$ such that

\begin{equation}
\boxed{A^\top = - A}
\end{equation}


The fact that complex numbers can be [[represented as a matrix|complex number#as-a-matrix]] suggests that we can also write Euler's formula as relating a [[matrix exponential]] of a [[skew-symmetric matrix]] and a [[rotation matrix]].

$$
\exp \left({\begin{bmatrix}0 & -x \\ x & 0\end{bmatrix}}\right) = \begin{bmatrix}\cos x & -\sin x \\ \sin x & \cos x\end{bmatrix}
$$

Skew-symmetric matrices make up the [[Lie algebra]] for the [[special orthogonal group]] and the [[orthogonal group]].

# Properties

* A skew-symmetric matrix has a diagonal of zeros. Therefore, its [[trace]] is zero.
