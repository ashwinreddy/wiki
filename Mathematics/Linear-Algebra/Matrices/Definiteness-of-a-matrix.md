A symmetric $n \times n$ matrix $A$ is positive semidefinite (PSD) if

\\[
\vec{x}^\mathsf{T}A\vec{x} \geq 0
\\]

It is positive definite if the above holds without equality.

# Examples

For a matrix $A$, $A^TA$ is PSD because we have $x^T A^TA x = (Ax)^T(Ax) \geq 0$ by [[norm]] rules.

# Eigenvalues

$M$ has (sign)-(fullness) definiteness iff all of its eigenvalues are (sign) with (fullness)
