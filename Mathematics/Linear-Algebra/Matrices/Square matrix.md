A **square matrix** is an $n \times n$ [[matrix]], which means the input and outputs are in the same space. That makes it an [[endomorphism]]. Thus, some operations are available exclusively to square matrices like the [[determinant]], [[eigenpairs]], or the concept of an [[invertible matrix]].

# Properties

* Any square matrix $A$ can be written as the sum of a [[symmetric matrix]] and a [[skew-symmetric matrix]]:

$$
A = \frac{1}{2}\left(A + A^\mathsf{T}\right) + \frac{1}{2}\left(A - A^\mathsf{T}\right)
$$

* Either [[singular matrix]] or [[invertible matrix]]
