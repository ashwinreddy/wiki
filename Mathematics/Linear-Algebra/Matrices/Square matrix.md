A **square matrix** is a [[matrix]] with an equal number of rows and columns (i.e. an $n\times n$ matrix). This means that a square matrix can represent a map from a vector space to itself. As such, certain operations only make sense on a square matrix. Example:

* [[Determinant]]
* Raising a matrix to a power
