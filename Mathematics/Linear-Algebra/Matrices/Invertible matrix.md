An **invertible matrix** is a [[square matrix]] $A$ with an inverse $A^{-1}$ such that

$$
AA^{-1}=A^{-1}A=I
$$

# Tests

* An invertible matrix will have a nonzero [[determinant]]
* An invertible matrix will not have zero as an [[eigenvalue|eigenpairs]].

# Properties

If $A$ has an inverse, then $A^\top$ has an inverse as well, which we can denote $A^{-\top}$.
