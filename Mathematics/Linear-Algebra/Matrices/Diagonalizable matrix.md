A **diagonalizable matrix** is a [[square matrix]] $A$ that can be decomposed with a [[diagonal matrix]] $D$ and invertible matrix $P$.

$$
A = PDP^{-1} \iff AP = PD
$$

You might notice that the $AP=PD$ condition is actually a way of simultaneously satisfying all the [[eigenpairs]] equations to realize

$$
AV = V \Lambda
$$
