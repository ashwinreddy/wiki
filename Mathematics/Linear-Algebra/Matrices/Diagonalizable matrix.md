A **diagonalizable matrix** is a [[square matrix]] $A$ that can be decomposed with a [[diagonal matrix]] $D$ and invertible matrix $V$.

$$
A = VDV^{-1} \iff AV = VD
$$

You might notice that $AV=VD$ is automatically satisfied with $V$ and $D$ are the [[eigenpairs]] represented as matrices.

$$
AV = V \Lambda
$$
