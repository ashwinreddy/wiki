A vector space is a set $V$ equipped with scalar multiplication $(\cdot): F \times V \to V$ for a field $F$ and vector addition $+: V \times V \to V$ that obey some nice properties. The existence of these two operations allows us to take weighted sums of vectors, known as linear combinations.

Examples of vector spaces include

1. Functions
2. $\RR^n$
2. Matrices
