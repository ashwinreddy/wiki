A **multilinear map** is a function $f$ that is linear separately in each of its arguments. 

$$f: V_1 \times \dots \times V_k \to W$$

That is, if we hold all inputs but one fixed, the response in the output is linear no matter which input is free. Clearly, a [[linear map]] is a multilinear map where there's only one vector as the input, but the case of two vectors as inputs, known as **bilinear maps**, is also common.
