A **multilinear map** is a function $f$ that is linear separately in each of its arguments. $$f: V_1 \times \dots \times V_k \to W$$ where the $V_i$ and $W$ are [[vector spaces|vector space]] that is linear in each of its $k$ variables. That is, if we hold all inputs but one fixed, the response in the output is linear no matter which input is free.
