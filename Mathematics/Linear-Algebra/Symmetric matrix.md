A **symmetric matrix** is a [[square matrix]] that is equal to its [[transpose]].

\begin{equation}
A = A^\mathsf{T}
\end{equation}

The term "symmetric" can be internalized by realizing that

$$
x^\mathsf{T} A y = y^\mathsf{T} A x
$$

# Characteristics

The signature of a symmetric matrix is the triple $(n_0, n_+, n_-)$ of the count of zero, positive, and negative eigenvalues.

 
# Properties

* A real symmetric matrix has only real eigenvalues.
