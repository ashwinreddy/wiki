An eigenvector $\vec{v}$ for a matrix $\bf A$ is one that satisfies the following equation for some corresponding eigenvalue $\lambda$.

\\[
\mathbf{A}\vec{v} = \lambda \vec{v}
\\]

_The zero vector does not count as an eigenvector, but zero can be an eigenvalue!_

The eigenvalues can be found by solving

\\[
\det(\mathbf{A} - \lambda \mathbf{I}) = 0
\\]

0 is an eigenvalue iff the determinant of $\bf A$ is 0.
