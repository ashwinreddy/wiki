An eigenvector $\vec{v}$ for a matrix $\bf A$ is one that satisfies the following equation for some corresponding eigenvalue $lambda$.

\\[
\mathbf{A}\vec{v} = \lambda \vec{v}
\\]

The eigenvalues can be found by solving

\\[
\det(\mathbf{A} - \lambda \mathbf{I}) = 0
\\]

If 0 is an eigenvalue, then the determinant of $\bf A$ is 0.
