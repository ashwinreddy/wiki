An **eigenpair** for a [[matrix]] consists of two pieces of information:

a) the lines which are invariant under the matrix multiplication
b) the scaling factors for those lines. 

Formally, it is a pair for a [[linear map]] $T$ on a [[vector space]] $V$ over a field $k$ is a $(\lambda \in k, \vec{v} \in V)$ satisfying 

\begin{equation}
T\left(\vec{v}\right) = \lambda \vec{v} \tag{Eigenequation}
\end{equation}

We call the $\lambda$ an **eigenvalue** and the [[vector]] $\vec{v}$ an **eigenvector**. Note that we typically exclude the zero vector for $v$ because it is trivially true; however, a zero eigenvalue is interesting because it means a non-trivial nullspace. 

Notice that if $(\lambda, \vec{v})$ is an eigenpair then $(\lambda, \alpha\vec{v})$ is also an eigenpair. In other words, an eigenvector is an [[equivalence class]] of vectors.

# Properties

The determinant of a triangular matrix is the product of diagonals. 
$$
\operatorname{tr}  A = \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i
$$
\begin{equation}
\det A = \prod_{i=1}^n \lambda_i
\end{equation}


# Computation

If our linear transformation in question is an $n \times n$ matrix $\mathbf{A}$, we can find the specific eigenpairs by first determining the eigenvalues. The trick is to recognize the asymmetry of the eigenequation (matrix-vector product vs scalar multiplication) and correct this by inserting a dummy [[identity matrix]].
$$
\begin{gather}
\mathbf{A}\vec{v} = \lambda \mathbf{I}\vec{v} \\\\\
\left(\mathbf{A} - \lambda \mathbf{I} \right)\vec{v} = 0
\end{gather}
$$
Luckily, we can ignore the $v$ in the last equation above and recognize that we must have a singular matrix, leaving us $\det(\mathbf{A} - \lambda \mathbf{I}) = 0$.

The equation above is called the [[characteristic equation|characteristic polynomial]] of $A$. It is a degree $n$ polynomial function of $\lambda$, so there are at most $n$ eigenvalues which can be found as roots. Then, the eigenvector is any element of the nullspace of $\mathbf{A} - \lambda\mathbf{I}$.
