A **set** is a collection or bag of objects. Sets have no notion of order or repetition. 

# Methods

The main operation on sets is a membership check: asking whether $x$ belongs to $S$. The notation $x \in S$ is true if $x$ belongs to $S$ and is false otherwise (we then write $x \not\in S$). 

How can we build sets? One way is to explicitly list what a set contains. Sets are allowed to contain sets. Another way is by using [[set-builder notation]].

We can also consider all the [[subsets|subset]] of a given set.
