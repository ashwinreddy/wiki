There are two parts to the **fundamental theorem of calculus**

\begin{equation}
\dv{}{x}\int_c^x f(x) \,\dd{x} = f(x) \tag{FTC 1}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ftc2}
\int_a^b f(x) \,\dd{x} = F(b) - F(a) \tag{FTC 2}
\end{equation}

# Towards Differential Forms

Notice that \ref{eq:ftc2} suggests that we can say something like

\begin{equation}
\int_a^b \dd{F} = F(b) - F(a)
\end{equation}

So perhaps the way to understand a differential $\dd{f}$ is that it is a function!
