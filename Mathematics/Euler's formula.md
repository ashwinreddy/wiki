**Euler's formula** expands the domain of the exponential function to complex numbers, by relating it to trigonometric functions.

\begin{equation}
e^{ix} = \overbrace{\cos x + \iota \sin x}^{\text{unit circle}} \tag{Euler}
\end{equation}

This idea can be more dramatically explained with a graph, by showing the left hand side as a vertical line and the right hand side as a circle.
