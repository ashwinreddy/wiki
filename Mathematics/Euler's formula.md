**Euler's formula** expands the domain of the [[exponential function]] to [[complex numbers|complex number]], by relating it to trigonometric functions.

\begin{equation}
e^{ix} = \overbrace{\cos x + \iota \sin x}^{\text{unit circle}} \tag{Euler}
\end{equation}

This sets up a correspondence that works in both directions

\begin{equation}
re^{i\theta} \longleftrightarrow a + b i
\end{equation}

The formula can be more dramatically explained with a graph, by showing the left hand side as a vertical line and the right hand side as a circle.
