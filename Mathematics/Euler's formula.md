**Euler's formula** relates trigonometric functions and the exponential function.

\begin{equation}
e^{ix} = \overbrace{\cos x + \iota \sin x}^{\text{unit circle}} \tag{Euler}
\end{equation}

This idea can be more dramatically explained with a graph, by showing the left hand side as a vertical line and the right hand side as a circle.

# Proof

Euler's original proof simply showed this using [[Maclaurin series|Taylor series#Maclaurin-series]] for [[sine]] and [[cosine]].
