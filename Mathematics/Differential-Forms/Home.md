The language of differential forms gives a coordinate independent and natural way of doing multivariable calculus.

A vector is written

\\[
v = v^{i} \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}
\\]

A dual vector, covector, 1-form is written

\\[
\alpha = \alpha_i dx^i
\\]

So then a dot product looks like

\\[
\alpha\cdot v = \left(\alpha_i dx^i\right)\left(v^i \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right) = \alpha_i v^i
\\]


# Types of Forms

A form $\alpha$ is closed if $d\alpha = 0$. It is exact if $a = d\beta$ for some form $\beta$. Every exact form is closed. By the Poincare lemma, every closed form on a contractible domain is exact.
