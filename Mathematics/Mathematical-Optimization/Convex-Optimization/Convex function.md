A **convex function** is a function $f$ whose [[epigraph]] is a [[convex set]]. Concretely, the domain of $f$ is a convex set and

$$
f(\theta \vec{x} + (1-\theta) \vec{y}) \leq \theta f(\vec{x}) + (1-\theta)f(\vec{y})
$$

What makes convex functions useful is that any point with gradient 0 is guaranteed to be a global minimum.
