A **convex set** is a [[set]] $C$ that contains every line segment between two of its points. If $C$ has a [[vector space]] structure, we can take linear combinations in $C$ and this condition amounts to

\begin{equation}
\forall c_1, c_2 \in C: \theta c_1 + (1-\theta)c_2 \in C,\qquad \theta \in [0,1]
\end{equation}

Examples of convex sets:

1. $\RR^n$
2. Half-space
3. A hyperplane
4. Positive semidefinite matrices
