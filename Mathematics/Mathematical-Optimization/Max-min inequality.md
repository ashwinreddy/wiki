The **max-min inequality** says that ${\displaystyle f:Z\times W\to \mathbb {R} }$,

$$
{\displaystyle \sup _{z\in Z}\inf _{w\in W}f(z,w)\leq \inf _{w\in W}\sup _{z\in Z}f(z,w).}
$$

A mnemonic to remember this is the "Paradise Lost Fallacy," where Lucifer incorrectly concludes:

> Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven.
