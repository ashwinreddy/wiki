**Lagrange multipliers** are introduced variables that help solve a constrained optimization problem. How to interpret them:

* The multiplier puts a price/cost on how much certain constraints can be violated.
* Therefore, if a multiplier is 0 it's because you don't have to violate the constraint.
* If it is positive, then the optimal is feasible but active at the constraint (i.e. you could change the answer by adjusting that constraint).
