**Slater's condition** guarantees [[strong duality]] for [[convex problem]]s based on the inequality constraints $f_1, \dots, f_m$. In particular, strong duality holds if there exists a point such that all inequality constraints hold strictly. However, this condition by itself is pessimistic: any affine inequality constraints don't need to hold strictly.
