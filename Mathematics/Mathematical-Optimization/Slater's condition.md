**Slater's condition** guarantees [[strong duality]] for [[convex problem]]s based on the inequality constraints $f_1, \dots, f_m$. In particular, strong duality holds if

* there exists a point such that all inequality constraints hold strictly.
* if $f_1, \dots, f_k$ are affine constraints, then they may hold with equality.
