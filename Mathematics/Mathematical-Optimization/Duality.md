**Duality** refers to lower bounding the solution to an optimization problem of the form

\begin{align} p^* = &\min_{\vec{x}} f_0(\vec{x}) \\\\\ &f_i(\vec{x}) \leq 0,\quad 1\leq i \leq m \\\\\ &h_i(\vec{x}) = 0, \quad 1 \leq i \leq p. \end{align}

with the solution to a dual problem, usually the [[Lagrange dual problem|Lagrange duality]]. The duality gap measures the discrepancy between the solutions.

Duality gap
: $p^* - d^* \geq 0$

If the duality gap is zero, we say **strong duality** holds. Otherwise, we can only rely on weak duality.
