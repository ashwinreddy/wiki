**Duality** refers to the ability to lower bound a minimization problem, known as the **primal**, with [[Lagrange multiplier]]s in the **dual problem**.

\begin{align}
\boxed{p^* = &\min_{\vec{x}} f_0(\vec{x}) \\\\\ &f_i(\vec{x}) \leq 0,\quad 1\leq i \leq m \\\\\ &h_i(\vec{x}) = 0, \quad 1 \leq i \leq p.}
\end{align}
