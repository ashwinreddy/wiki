> But now, in headline terms, _Gödel’s First Incompleteness Theorem shows that the entirely natural idea that we can give a complete theory of basic arithmetic with a tidy set of axioms is wrong._ [@smith2013introduction]

> But the official First Theorem has already shown that if T is consistent we can’t derive \sansG T in T. So it immediately follows that if T is consistent it can’t prove \sansC \sanso \sansn T . And that is Gödel’s Second Incompleteness Theorem. Roughly in- terpreted: nice theories that include enough basic arithmetic can’t prove their own consistency. [@smith2013introduction]
