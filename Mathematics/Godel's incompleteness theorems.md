> But now, in headline terms, _Gödel’s First Incompleteness Theorem shows that the entirely natural idea that we can give a complete theory of basic arithmetic with a tidy set of axioms is wrong._ [@smith2013introduction]

> But the official First Theorem has already shown that if $T$ is consistent we can’t derive $\mathsf{G}_T$ in $T$. So it immediately follows that if $T$ is consistent it can’t prove $\mathsf{Con}_T$. And that is Gödel’s Second Incompleteness Theorem. Roughly interpreted: nice theories that include enough basic arithmetic can’t prove their own consistency. [@smith2013introduction]
