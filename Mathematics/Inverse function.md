**Inverse function** for a [[function]] $f$ is a function denoted $f^{-1}$ such that [[function composition]] is [[identity function]].

# Derivative

Suppose $f$ and $g$ are inverses. Then $(f \circ g)$ is the [[identity map]]. By chain rule, we know that

$$
f'(g(x))g'(x) = 1 \implies g'(x) = \frac{1}{f'(g(x))}
$$
