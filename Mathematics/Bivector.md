A **bivector** is an oriented segment of the plane, considered unchanged as long as the area is retained.



2-blade (a "simple" bivector) or the sum of 2-blades. A 2-blade is just the [[wedge product]] of vectors. For example, in 2-dimensions there is the bivector

\begin{equation}
e_{12} = e_1 \wedge e_2
\end{equation}
