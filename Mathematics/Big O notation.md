**Big O notation** is used to describe limit behavior of a function. 

# Big O

$O(g(x))$ defines an equivalence class of functions $f(x)$ such that

\begin{equation}
\limsup_{x \to a} \left\vert \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \right\vert  < \infty
\end{equation}

Basically $O(x^n)$ refers to anything that grows slower than $x^n$
