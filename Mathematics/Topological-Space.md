A topological space is an ordered pair (X, τ), where X is a set and τ is a collection of subsets of X, satisfying the following axioms:

1. The empty set and X itself belong to τ.
2. Any arbitrary (finite or infinite) union of members of τ still belongs to τ.
3. The intersection of any finite number of members of τ still belongs to τ.

The elements of τ are called open sets and the collection τ is called a topology on X.
