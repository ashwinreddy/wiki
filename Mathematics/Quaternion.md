**Quaternions** are an extension of complex numbers and the predecessors of the more modern notion of a vector. In a eureka moment by Sir William Rowan Hamilton, the quaternions are defined by the multiplication of its basis elements provided by the equation

\begin{equation}
i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1 \tag{Hamilton}
\end{equation}

# Rotations

A quaternion can be used to compute a rotation in 3D.

\begin{equation}
\operatorname{Rotation in 3D}: \RR^3 \times \overbrace{\RR^3 \times \RR}^{\mathbb{H}} \to \RR^3
\end{equation}
