**Quaternions** are an extension of [[complex number]]s.

$$
i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1
$$

Just as [[complex number]]s can be represented using matrices, we can extend by defining

\begin{gather\*}
j = \begin{bmatrix}0 & \iota \\\\\ \iota & 0\end{bmatrix} \\\\\
k = \begin{bmatrix}\iota & 0\\\\\ 0 & -\iota\end{bmatrix} \\\\\
\end{gather\*}

In essence, we've shown that quaternions are isomorphic to [[special unitary group]] $SU(2)$
