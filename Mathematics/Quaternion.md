**Quaternions** are an extension of [[complex number]]s, useful for describing rotations in 3D. The set of quaternions is denoted $\mathbb{H}$ for William Rowan Hamilton. A quaternion is in general written as

$$
q = a + b i + c j + dk, \quad a,b,c,d \in \RR
$$


\begin{equation}
i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1
\end{equation}
