**Quaternions** are an extension of [[complex number]]s, useful for describing rotations in 3D. A quaternion $q = a + b i + c j + dk$. Quaternion multiplication is defined by the following equation, discovered by William Rowan Hamilton. The set of quaternions is denoted $\mathbb{H}$ after him.

\begin{equation}
i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1
\end{equation}
