**Quaternions** are an extension of [[complex number]]s, useful for describing rotations in 3D. They can be thought of as a [[vector space]] over $\RR^4$. A quaternion is a 

$$
q = a + b i + c j + dk
$$

Quaternion multiplication is defined by the following equation, discovered by William Rowan Hamilton. The set of quaternions is denoted $\mathbb{H}$ after him.

\begin{equation}
i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1
\end{equation}

Like complex numbers, quaternions have conjugates.

$$
\bar{q} = a - bi - cj - dk
$$
