The **Laplace transform** is an [[integral transform]].

\begin{equation}
\mathscr{L} \left\\{ f(t) \right\\} \doteq \int_0^\infty f(t) e^{-st} \dd{t}
\end{equation}

The transform can be used to turn [[differential equation]] into algebraic ones that can be solved easily and converted back into solutions.

|$f(t)$|$F(s)$|

[[Convolution]] is multiplication.
