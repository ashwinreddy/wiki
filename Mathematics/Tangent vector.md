A **tangent vector** is the velocity you could be or are going at for a point on a [[manifold]]. In the high school physics setting, it suffices to say this. However, for differential geometry, we need a more flexible definition. A tangent vector $v$ is a map

\begin{equation}
v: C^\infty(M) \to \RR
\end{equation}
