A **tangent vector** is the velocity you could be or are going at for a point on a [[manifold]]. In the high school physics setting, it suffices to say this. However, for differential geometry, we need a more flexible definition. A tangent vector $v$ is a map

\begin{align}
v: C^\infty(M) &\to \RR \\\\\
f(x) &\mapsto \partial_{v} f(x)
\end{align}
