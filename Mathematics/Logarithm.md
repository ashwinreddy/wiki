A **logarithm** is the inverse of an [[exponential function]], meaning

\begin{equation}
b^{\log_b a } \equiv a
\end{equation}

> The log of products is the sum of logs.

\begin{equation}
\log \prod_i x_i = \sum_i \log x_i
\end{equation}

Common bases are 2, $e$, and 10. To write these succinctly, we use $\lg$, $\ln$, and $\log$, respectively. However, all logarithms are equivalent up to a factor, which allows us to use one of these common bases in any scenario.

\begin{equation}
\log_b x = \frac{\ln x}{\ln b} \tag{Change of Base}
\end{equation}

Why does this work? 

\begin{equation}
\ln b \log_b x = \ln x
\end{equation}
