The **quadratic** formula gives the roots to the function $ax^2+bx+c$:

\begin{equation}
x = \frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
\end{equation}


#### Discriminant

\begin{equation}
D = b^2 - 4ac
\end{equation}

If $D$ is

- $>0$, then the quadratic has 2 real solutions
- $=0$, then the quadratic has 1 real solution that counts twice or repeats, known as a double root
- $<0$, then the quadratic has a [conjugate pair of complex roots](../Complex Numbers/Complex Conjugate)
