Lagrange multipliers are a technique for solving constrained optimization. Suppose we want to find optima for $f(\vec{x})$ while obeying $g(\vec{x})=k$.

\\[
\mathcal{L}(\vec{x}, \lambda) = f(\vec{x}) - \lambda g(\vec{x})
\\]

Solving the constrained optimization reduces to finding solutions of $\nabla \mathcal{L} = 0$.
