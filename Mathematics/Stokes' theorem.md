**Stokes' theorem** is the idea that one can compute an [[integral]] by just considering the differential on the boundaries. Concretely, one can convert an integral of $\omega$ on a [[manifold]] $M$ to an integral of the [[exterior derivative]] on the boundary.

\begin{equation}
\int_{\partial M} \omega = \int_{M} \dd{\omega} \tag{Stokes' theorem}
\end{equation}
