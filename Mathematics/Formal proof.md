A **proof** of a [[proposition]] $p$ within an [[axiomatic system]] $a_1, \dots, a_N$ is a finite sequence of propositions $q_1, \dots q_M$ such that for any $1 \leq j \leq M$, 

1. $q_j$ is a proposition from the list of axioms, or
2. $q_j$ is a tautology, or
3. [[modus ponens]] $q_m \land q_n \implies q_j$ for $1 \leq m, n \leq j$.
