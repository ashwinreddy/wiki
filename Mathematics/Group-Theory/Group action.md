A group action of a [[group]] $G$ on a [[set]] $X$ is a map $\varphi: G \times X \to X$ obeying the following properties.

Identity
: $\varphi(e, x) = x$ if $e$ is the identity element in $G$

Compatability
: $\varphi(g, \varphi(h, x)) = \varphi(gh, x)$

The comptability condition intuitively says that the map needs to respect the group action. 

# Examples

A trivial example is $\varphi(g, x) = x$. Clearly, identity holds and it's easy to check compatability.
