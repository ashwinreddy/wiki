The **general linear group** of degree _n_ is the [[group]] $\operatorname{GL}_n(F)$ of $n \times n$ invertible matrices over $F$ with [[matrix multiplication]]. This is the broadest group that can be made with matrices because we need to guarantee the existence of inverses for a group.

We can also construct a general linear group from a [[vector space]] $V$ by collecting all bijective linear transformations $V \to V$ and equipping the operation of [[function composition]].
