The direct product of [[group]]s $(G,\diamondsuit)$ and $(H, \heartsuit)$ is denoted $G \times H$ and consists of $(g,h)$ with the product given by $(g,h)\cdot(g',h')=(g \diamondsuit g', h \heartsuit h')$.

# Examples

Consider the group of real numbers over addition, $\RR$. The direct product of $\RR$ with itself is isomorphic to $\RR^2$.

$$
\RR \times \RR \cong \RR^2
