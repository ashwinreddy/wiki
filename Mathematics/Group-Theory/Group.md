A **group** is a set $G$ equipped with a closed binary composition operation $(\cdot): G \times G \to G$ that obeys

Identity existence
: There is an element $I \in G$ such that $\forall A \in G, I \cdot A = A$

Invertibility
: Every $A$ has a friend $A^{-1}$ so that $A^{-1}\cdot A = I$

Associativity
: $A \cdot (B \cdot C) = (A \cdot B) \cdot C$, which allows us to drop the $\cdot$ altogether unambiguously.


A **subgroup** for $G$ is a subset $H$ that satisfies the above given the same operation $(\cdot)$.
