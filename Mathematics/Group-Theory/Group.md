A **group** is a set $G$ equipped with a closed binary composition operation $(\cdot): G \times G \to G$ that obeys

Identity existence
: There is an element $I \in G$ such that $\forall a \in G, I \cdot a=a$

Invertibility
: Every $a$ has a friend $a^{-1}$ so that $a^{-1}\cdot a = I$

Associativity
: $a \cdot (b \cdot c) = (a \cdot b) \cdot c$, which allows us to drop the $\cdot$ altogether unambiguously.

An abelian group is one for which $ab=ba$.

A **subgroup** for $G$ is a subset $H$ that satisfies the above given the same operation $(\cdot)$.
