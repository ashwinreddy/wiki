A **group generator** is a set of group elements that is capable of producing all the elements in a group, similar to [[basis]].

Formally, consider a group $G$ and some elements $a_i$. The elements $a_i$ generate $G'$, the intersection of all [[subgroup]]s of $G$ that contain all the elements $a_i$.

# Examples

* The additive group $\mathbb{Z}$ is generated by the element 1.
* The [[special linear group]] is generated by [[elementary matrices|elementary matrix]].
* The [[general linear group]] is generated by elementary matrices and those of the form
