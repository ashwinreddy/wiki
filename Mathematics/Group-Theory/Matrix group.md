A **matrix group** is a [[group]] of [[invertible matrices|invertible matrix]].

The **tangent space** to a matrix group at the identity is a subspace of the vector space of matrices:

$$
T_G = \left\{ \gamma'(0) | \gamma : (-\epsilon, \epsilon) \to G \text{ differentiable curve with } \gamma(0) = I\right\}
$$
