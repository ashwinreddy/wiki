The direct product of [[group]]s $(G,\diamondsuit)$ and $(H, \heartsuit)$ is denoted $G \times H$ and consists of $(g,h)$ with the product given by $(g,h)\cdot(g',h')=(g \diamondsuit g', h \heartsuit h')$.

Example:

Consider the group of real numbers over addition, $\RR$.

$$
\mathbb{R}\times{R} \cong \mathbb{R}^2
$$
