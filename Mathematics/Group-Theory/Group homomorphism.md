A **group homomorphism** is a function that "preserves" group multiplication. Given two groups $(G, \diamondsuit)$ and $(H, \heartsuit)$, a homomorphism is a function $f: G \to H$ such that

\begin{equation}
f( g_1 \diamondsuit g_2 ) = f(g_1) \heartsuit f(g_2)
\end{equation}

A homomorphism in and of itself is not that exciting: one can always generate the trivial homomorphism.

Trivial homomorphism
: A homomorphism $f(g) = e_H$ for any $g \in G$ is trivially a homomorphism.
