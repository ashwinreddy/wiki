The **tangent space** $T_p M$ for a [[manifold]] $M$ at a point $p$ consists of all the [[tangent vectors|tangent vector]] going through $p$.  Compactly, we write 

$$
T_pM \doteq \left \\{\dot\gamma(0) \mid \gamma(0) = p\right\\}.
$$

A choice of coordinate system $x^i$ induces a basis for the tangent space:

\begin{equation}
e_i = \pdv{}{x^i}
\end{equation}

# Formal construction

The tangent space is the set of derivations $X_p: C^\infty(M) \to \mathbb{R}$.
