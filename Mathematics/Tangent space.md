The **tangent space** $T_p M$ for a [[manifold]] $M$ at a point $p$ consists of all the [[tangent vectors|tangent vector]] going through $p$.  Compactly, we write 

$$
T_pM \triangleq \left \\{\dot\gamma(0) \mid \gamma(0) = p\right\\}.
$$

A choice of coordinate system $x^i$ induces a [[basis]] for the tangent space:

\begin{equation}
T_p M = \operatorname{span}\left\\{ \right\\}
\end{equation}

The [[cotangent space]] is the [[dual vector space]] of the tangent space.

# Formal construction

The tangent space is the set of derivations $X_p: C^\infty(M) \to \mathbb{R}$. In other words, to fashion a tangent space we just need to be able to take derivatives of vectors?
