**Phase space** is the space of all possible states for a dynamical system. In physics, this can often be the [[cotangent bundle]] $T^\*Q = \\{(q, p) \mid q \in Q, p \in T^*_q M\\}$ if $Q$ is the [[configuration space]] [@tao2008phase]. This bundle tracks position $q$ and its conjugate momentum $p$ and comes equipped with the [[symplectic form]] $\omega = \dd{p} \wedge \dd{q}$.
