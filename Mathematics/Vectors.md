## Vectors

Vectors are powerful objects used in mathematics, physics, and computer science. Often, students are introduced to vectors as arrows in space or as an array of numbers. While both interpretations are reasonably valid for their given contexts, we will use a broader definition.


A vector space defines a set of vectors. A vector space is equipped with addition under closure and scalar multiplication. Additionally, the basic properties of associativity and commutativity must apply.


The simplest example of a vector space that you are familiar with is a function space. We can add functions and get back a new function that follows the basic rules of addition. We can also multiply a function by a constant.



Let $L$ be a transformation rule for a vector space. $L$ is linear iff for vectors $x$ and $y$ and scalar constants $\alpha$ and $\beta$

$$
L(\alpha x+ \beta y) = \alpha L(x) + \beta L(y)
$$

An inner product space equips a vector space with an operation called the inner product. The inner product takes two vectors and returns a scalar. When the inner product of a vector is taken with the same vector, the value must never be negative.^[This property is known as positive definiteness.]



At this point, it makes sense to switch to the interpretation of vectors in Euclidean space.
