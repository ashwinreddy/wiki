A **topology** is the weakest structure that can be imposed upon a set to establish a notion of continuity.

# Mathematical Construction

A topology on a set $M$ is an $\mathcal{O} \subseteq \mathscr{P}$


[[Metric Space]]

A **ball** of radius $r$ around a point $x \in X$ is $B := \\{y \in X \vert d(x,y) < r\\}$

A subset $O \subseteq X$ is **open** if for every point $x \in O$, there is a ball around $x$ entirely contained in $O$.
