**Duality**. Suppose you are given an [[optimization problem]], which we'll call the _primal problem_. In weak duality, the dual feasible solution is greater than or equal to the primal feasible when the primal is a maximization, o/w reversed. In strong duality, the primal optimal is the dual optimal.
