**Linear programming** is optimization with [[linear|linear map]] objectives and constraints. 

$$
\begin{aligned}
\min \quad & c^\mathsf{T} x \\\\
\textrm{s.t.} \quad & Ax \geqslant b\\\\
  & x \geqslant 0    
\end{aligned}
$$

There are only 3 situations:

1. Optimum achieved at vertex of feasible region.
2. Problem infeasible.
3. Feasible region unbounded.
