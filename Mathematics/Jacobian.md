The **Jacobian** of a function $f: \RR^m \to \RR^n$ is the collection of [[partial derivatives|partial derivative]] for every input-output combination, which we can organize into a [[matrix]]. The [[determinant]] of Jacobian is often useful.

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{J}_{ij} \doteq \pdv{f_i}{x_j}
\end{equation}
