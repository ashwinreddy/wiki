For a [[differentiable manifold]] $M$, the tangent space $T_pM$ is a copy of $\RR^n$ tangential to $M$ at $p$. A smooth curve $\gamma$ passing through $p$ will have a derivative vector that belongs to $T_p M$.

$$
T_p M = \{\vartheta_{\gamma , p} | \gamma \text{ smooth curve} \}
$$

Where $\gamma: \RR \to M$, $\gamma(\lambda_0) = p$ and $\vartheta$ is a linear map

\begin{align}
\vartheta_{\gamma, p}: C^\infty(M) &\to \RR \\\\\
f &\mapsto
\end{align}
