The **exterior derivative** of is an operator $\mathbb{d}: \Omega^p(X) \to \Omega^{p+1}(X)$ for a [[differentiable manifold]] $X$ where $\Omega$ is the set of [[differential forms|differential form]].


$$
\dd{A}_{i_1 \dots i_{p+1}} = (p+1)! \cdot \partial_{[i_1} A_{i_2\dots i_{p+1}]}
$$

Properties:

$$
\dd{(A \wedge B)} = \dd{A} \wedge B + (-1)^p A \wedge \dd{B}
$$

Nilpotency
: $\dd{(\dd{A})} = 0$, which is sometimes just written as $d^2 = 0$
