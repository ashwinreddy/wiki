The metric tensor (aka first fundamental form) $g$ is a $(0,2)$ [[tensor]] written as a non-negative [[symmetric matrix]] with entries given by

$$
\lVert \vec{v} \rVert^2 = \left(v^i \vec{e}_i\right)\left( v^j \vec{e}_j\right)
$$

$$
g_{ij} = \vec{e}_i \cdot \vec{e}_j
$$

# Group representation

If we have a [[group representation]] of $G$, then vectors will transform as $\vec{r} \to A\vec{r}$ under the group while dual vectors $\tilde{r}$
