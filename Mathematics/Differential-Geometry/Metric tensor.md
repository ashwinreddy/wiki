The **metric tensor** or **first fundamental form** $g$ induces on each [[tangent plane|tangent space]] $T_p$ an [[inner product]] space that allows one to measure vector magnitudes (vector “lengths”) and angles/orthogonality between vectors. [@nielsen2018elementary]

The metric tensor forms a [[quadratic form]] on the [[tangent space]]

$$
q_p(X_m) = g_p(X_m, X_m)
