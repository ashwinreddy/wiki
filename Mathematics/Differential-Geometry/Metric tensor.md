The **metric tensor** or **first fundamental form** $g$ is a generalized dot product for a manifold, which may vary at each point. In terms of signature, this requires a [[tangent bundle]].

\begin{equation}
g: TM \times TM \to \RR
\end{equation}

The metric is bilinear, symmetric, and nondegenerate.
