The **pushforward** or total derivative of a differentiable mapping $f: M \to N$ at a point $x \in M$ is

$$
{\displaystyle \mathrm {d} {f }_{x}:T_{x}M\to T_{f (x)}N}
$$

Consider a curve $\varphi: \RR \to M$ with $\varphi(0)=x$ and velocity $v = \dv{\varphi}{t}\vert_{t=0}$

$$
\mathrm{d} f_x(v) = \dv{}{t}\bigg\vert_{t=0} f(\varphi(t)) = f'(\varphi(t))v
$$
