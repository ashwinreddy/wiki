A **Riemannian manifold** is a $(M,g)$ where $M$ is a $C^\infty$-manifold and $g$ is a smoothly-varying metric on the $T_p M$.


At any point $P$ in a pseudo-Riemannian manifold, it is possible in principle to find local Cartesian coordinates $x'^a$ such that

$\let\sb_$

\\[
\begin{cases}
g'\sb{ab}(P) = \eta_{ab} \\\
\frac{\partial g'_{ab}}{\partial x'^c}\Big\lvert_P = 0
\end{cases}
\\]


A Riemannian manifold has a natural volume form, which in local coordinates is expressed as 

\begin{equation}
\omega = \sqrt{|g|} \mathrm{d}x^1 \wedge \dots \wedge \mathrm{d}x^n
\end{equation}
