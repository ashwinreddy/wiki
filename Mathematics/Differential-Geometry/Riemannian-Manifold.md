At any point $P$ in a pseudo-Riemannian manifold, it is possible in principle to find local Cartesian coordinates $x'^a$ such that

g'\sb{ab}(P) = \eta_{ab}

A Riemannian manifold has a natural volume form, which in local coordinates is expressed as 

\begin{equation}
\omega = \sqrt{|g|} \mathrm{d}x^1 \wedge \dots \wedge \mathrm{d}x^n
\end{equation}
