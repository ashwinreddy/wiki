The **affine connection** is a [[binary operation]] on nearby tangent spaces that connects nearby [[tangent spaces|tangent space]]. The operation has the following signature

\begin{align}
\nabla: \mathfrak{X}(M) \times \mathfrak{X}(M) &\to \mathfrak{X}(M) \\\\\
(X, Y) &\mapsto \nabla_X Y
\end{align}

Suppose $X$ and $Y$ are [[vector fields|vector field]] and $f$ is a smooth function

* $\nabla_{fX}Y = f\nabla_X Y$
* $\nabla_X (fY) = \dd{f}(X) Y + f\nabla_X Y$
