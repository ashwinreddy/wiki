A **tangent vector** 

# High school / geometric definition

Consider all the smooth curves that go through a point $p$. For each of those curves, calculate the derivative. Collect all these derivatives. These are all the tangent vectors.


# University / analytic definition

to a [[manifold]] $M$ at a point $p$ is an [[equivalence class]] of curves $\varphi(t)$ with $\varphi(0)=p$. If we have a chart $U$ for $M$, then the components of the vector are the numbers $\xi_1, \dots, \xi_n$ such that

$$
\xi_i = \dv{\varphi_i}{t}\bigg\vert_{t=0}
$$
