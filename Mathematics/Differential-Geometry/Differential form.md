A **differential form** is, roughly speaking, an object that we can [[integrate|integral]]. Recall that an integral is computing the accumulation of some value over a path. Then, operationally,

A differential 1-form on a manifold $M$ would be a [[linear map]] on the [[tangent bundle]] $\alpha: TM \to \RR$.

# Types

Exact form
: An $n$-form $\omega$ is exact if $\omega = \dd{\eta}$ for some $\eta$
