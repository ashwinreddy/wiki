A differential $p$-form is a $(0,p)$ tensor that is completely antisymmetric. 

In $D \geq p$ dimensions it has $D \choose p$ components. Note:

* In $D$ dimensions, a $p$ form has 1 component.
* 


A scalar field $f$ has a differential one-form $\dd{f}$ for coordinates $x^i$.

$$
\dd{f} = \pdv{f}{x^i}\dd{x^i}
$$
