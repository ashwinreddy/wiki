A **differential $k$-form** at $p$ for a [[manifold]] $M$ is a

$$
\omega: T_p M \times \dots \times T_p M \to \RR
$$



An $m$-form could be on a [[tangent space]] $T_p \RR^n$ is an [[alternating multilinear map]]

$$
\omega: (T_p \RR\^n)^m \to \RR
$$

> a differential form is a rule for assigning to each “infinitesimal $n$-cube” a number. [@df]
