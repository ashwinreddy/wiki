A **differential $k$-form** at $p$ for a [[manifold]] $M$ is a [[alternating multilinear map]]

$$
\omega: (T_p M)^k \to \RR.
$$

Let us denote the set of differential $k$-forms at $p$ with $\bigwedge_k T^*_p M$. This set can be easily upgraded to a [[vector space]].

A differential form can be defined over the manifold by making sure its defined at each point.
