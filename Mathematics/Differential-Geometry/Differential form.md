A differential $p$-form is a $(0,p)$ tensor that is completely antisymmetric. 

In $D \geq p$ dimensions it has $D \choose p$ components. Note in $D$ dimensions, a $D$ form is called a top form and has 1 component.


A scalar field $f$ has a differential one-form $\dd{f}$ for coordinates $x^i$.

$$
\dd{f} = \pdv{f}{x^i}\dd{x^i}
$$
