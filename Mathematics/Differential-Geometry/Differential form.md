A **differential form** gives meaning to the notation $\dd{x}$, $\dd{y}$, $\dd{z}$ seen in multivariable calculus. They are [[dual vectors|dual space]] to the [[partial derivative]] operators that make up the [[tangent space]]. A differential $k$-form on $\RR^n$ is a function

\alpha: \RR^n \to \Lambda_k(T\mathbb{R}^n)
