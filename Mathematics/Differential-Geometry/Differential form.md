A differential $p$-form is a $(0,p)$ tensor that is completely antisymmetric. 

In $D \geq p$ dimensions it has $D \choose p$ components. Note in $D$ dimensions, a $D$ form is called a top form and has 1 component.


A scalar field $f$ has a differential one-form $\dd{f}$ for coordinates $x^i$.

$$
\dd{f} = \pdv{f}{x^i}\dd{x^i}
$$


For a $p$-[[differential form]] $A$ and $q$-form $B$, $A \wedge B$ is a $p+q$ form

$$
\left(A \wedge B\right)_{i_1\dots i_{p+q}} = {p + q \choose p} A_{[i_1 \dots i_p}B_{i_{p+1}\dots i_{p+q}]}
$$

$$
A \wedge B = (-1)^{pq} B \wedge A
$$
