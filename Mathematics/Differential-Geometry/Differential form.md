A **differential $p$-form** is an element of the space

$$
\Omega^p(M) = C^\infty(\bigwedge^p T^* M)
$$



An $m$-form could be on a [[tangent space]] $T_p \RR^n$ is an [[alternating multilinear map]]

$$
\omega: (T_p \RR\^n)^m \to \RR
$$

> a differential form is a rule for assigning to each “infinitesimal $n$-cube” a number. [@df]
