A **differential form** is an integrand, something that can be integrated over. In 

$$
\int_0^1 x^2 \dd{x},
$$

the integrand is $x^2 \dd{x}$.



$k$-form** at $p$ for a [[manifold]] $M$ is a [[alternating multilinear map]]

$$
\omega: (T_p M)^k \to \RR.
$$

Let us denote the set of differential $k$-forms at $p$ with $\bigwedge_k T^*_p M$. This set can be easily upgraded to a [[vector space]].

A differential form can be defined over the manifold by making sure its defined at each point. 

A differential 0-form is just a function while a differential 1-form is a linear combination of the $\dd{x}^i$'s in local coordinates. Higher order forms are formed (pun intended) with the [[wedge product]].
