A **minimum spanning tree (MST)** is a [[spanning tree]] for a [[graph]] with minimal total edge weights. You can use [[Kruskal's algorithm]]

# Cut property

Let a crossing edge for a [[cut]] be an edge connecting nodes on different sides of the cut. Then,

> The crossing edge with minimum weight is in an MST.
