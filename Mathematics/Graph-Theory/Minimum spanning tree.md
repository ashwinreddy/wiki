A **minimum spanning tree (MST)** is a [[spanning tree]] for a [[graph]] with minimal total edge weights.

# [[Cut]] property

Suppose edges $X$ are part of a MST for graph $G = (V,E)$. Pick any subset of nodes $S$ for which $X$ does not cross between $S$ and $V \setminus S$ and let $e$ be the lightest edge across this partition. Then $X \cup \\{ e\\}$ is part of some MST.
