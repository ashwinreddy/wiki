Slater's condition guarantees strong duality for a class of convex optimization problems.

For a generic convex optimization problem with inequality constraints $f_i$, Slater's condition is that there exists a point $\vec{x}_0$ such that any affine constraints in $f_i(\vec{x}_0) \leq 0$ and all other inequality constraints have $f_i(\vec{x}_0) &lt; 0$.
