A **Cauchy sequence** is a sequence whose elements become arbitrarily close to each other as the sequence progresses.

Given a metric space $(X, d)$, a sequence $a_n$ is Cauchy if for every positive real number $\epsilon > 0$, there is a positive integer $N$ such that for all positive integers $m, n > N$, the distance $d(a_m, a_n) < \epsilon$.
