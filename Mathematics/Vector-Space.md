A **vector space** is a [[set]] $V$ equipped with operators $+:V \times V \to V$ and a $\cdot: \mathbb{R}\times V \to V$ satisfying the vector space axioms.



**Theorem**. $\dim V < \infty \implies \left(V^\ast\right)^\ast \cong_{\text{vec}} V$

Since partial derivatives are basis vectors, we can write

\begin{equation}
v^i = \vec{v}\cdot\vec\nabla x^i
\end{equation}

A subset $B \subset V$ of a vector space $V$ is a basis if for all vectors in $V$, there's a finite subset of $B$ such that the vectors can be uniquely written as a linear combination of basis vectors and components.
