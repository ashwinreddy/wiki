**Scientific notation** represents a [[real number]] $x$ in the form $$x = m \times \underbrace{10}_{}^n$$ where $m$ is called the significand or mantissa and $n$ is an [[integer]]. In contexts where the $\times$ symbol is not available, we use a capital _E_ (e.g. `1.4E3` means $1.4 \times 10^3$). Scientific notation is computationally helpful because if we can say $x=(m,n)$, then

$$
xy = (m_x m_y, n_x+n_y)
$$
