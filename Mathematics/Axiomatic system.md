An **axiomatic system** is a finite sequence of propositions $a_1, \dots, a_N$, which we call axioms.

Consistent
: An axiomatic system is consistent if there exists a proposition which cannot be [[proven|formal proof]] from the axioms

Why do we define consistency this way? If our axioms include $p$ and $\neg p$, then we can prove anything we like.
