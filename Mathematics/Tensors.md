Tensors are objects that transform predictably in different coordinate systems. Thus, a tensor equation is powerful because it holds in all coordinate systems. 

# Nomenclature

The type or valence of a tensor is a pair of whole numbers $(n,m)$ representing the number of vectors and dual vectors needed to form the tensor.
