**Tensors** are objects that transform predictably in different coordinate systems. Thus, a tensor equation is powerful because it holds in all coordinate systems. 

# Nomenclature

The type or valence of a tensor is a pair of whole numbers $(n,m)$ representing the number of vectors and dual vectors needed to form the tensor. Tensors are formed from vectors and dual vectors using the tensor product.

# Metric Tensor

$$
g_{ij} = \vec{e}_i \cdot \vec{e}_j
$$

$$
A\cdot B = g_{\mu\nu}A^\mu B^\nu
$$

$$
\mathrm{d}s^2 = g_{ij}\mathrm{d}x^i\mathrm{d}x^j
$$

# Tensor Operations

$$
\nabla^2 = \delta^{ij}\partial_i\partial_j
$$
