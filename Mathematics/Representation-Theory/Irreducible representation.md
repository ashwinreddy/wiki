An **irreducible representation** (abbreviated **irrep**) is a [[group representation]] $\rho: G \to \mathrm{GL}(V)$ that cannot be broken down further. Concretely, it must only have trivial subrepresentations (i.e. $V$ and the zero vector space).

$G$-invariant
: A [[linear subspace]] $W \subset V$ is $G$-invariant if the [[group action]] is [[closed|closure]] under $W$. That is, $\rho(g)w \in W$ for all $g \in G$ and $w \in W$.

Subrepresentation
: The restriction of $\rho$ to a $G$-invariant subspace.

This requires that the only vector spaces that get mapped to themselves for all $g \in G$ are the zero subspace and $V$ itself.
