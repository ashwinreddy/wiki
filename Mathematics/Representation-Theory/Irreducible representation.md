An **irreducible representation** (abbreviated **irrep**) is a [[group representation]] $\rho: G \to \mathrm{GL}(V)$ that cannot be broken down further.

$G$-invariant
: A [[linear subspace]] $W \subset V$ is $G$-invariant if the [[group action]] is [[closed|closure]] under $W$. That is, $\rho(g)w \in W$ for all $g \in G$ and $w \in W$.

This requires that the only vector spaces that get mapped to themselves for all $g \in G$ are the zero subspace and $V$ itself.
