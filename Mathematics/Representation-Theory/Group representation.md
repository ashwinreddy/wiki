A **group representation** describes a [[group]] $G$ using matrices. Formally, this will require a [[group homomorphism]] in order to maintain the structure. The codomain is a set of matrices, considered as a group: this is the [[general linear group]] on a [[vector space]].

\begin{align\*}
\rho: G &\longrightarrow \operatorname{GL}(V) \\\\\
g_1g_2 &\longmapsto \rho(g_1)\rho(g_2)
\end{align\*}
