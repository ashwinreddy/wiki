A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 whose only divisors are 1 and itself. There are an infinite number of primes by [[Euclid's theorem]].

Primes are useful because of the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]] which enables [[integer factorization]].

# Checking

There is in general no efficient way to check if a number $n$ is prime other than to check that no number below it divides it. However, we only have to check from 2 to $\lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor$. See [[composite number]].
