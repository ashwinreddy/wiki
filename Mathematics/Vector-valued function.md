A **vector-valued function** is a function whose output is a vector. Pedantically, a scalar valued function is a vector-valued function, but this misses the utility of defining such a term in the first place. 

A vector-valued function can be dissociated into $n$ appropriate scalar-valued functions that provide the value for each index.
