The **Legendre transform** of a [[convex function]] $f: I \to \RR$ for an interval $I \subseteq \RR$ is given by

$$
f\^\star\left(p\right) = \sup_{x \in I} (px - f(x))
$$

First, think of $p = f'(x)$. Then, recall that

$$
\mathsf{tangent}_{x_0}(x) = f(x_0) + f'(x_0)(x-x_0)
$$

It is the negative of the $y$-intercept of the tangent line to the graph of $f$ that has slope $p$.
