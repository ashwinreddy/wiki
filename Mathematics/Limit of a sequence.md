A **limit for a sequence** is the value that a [[sequence]] approaches, if any. We can use the $\epsilon$-$N$ definition. We pick an arbitrary $\epsilon > 0$, which will represent an error tolerance, and show that there is an $N$ such that $n > N$ implies $| s_n - s | < \epsilon$ (i.e. there is some point where you are guaranteed to always be below the error tolerance).

Some useful examples include

$$
\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{1}{n^p} = 0,\qquad p > 0
$$

$$
\lim_{n \to\infty} a^n = 0,\qquad |a| < 1
$$

$$
\lim_{n \to\infty} n^{1/n} = 1
$$

$$
\lim_{n \to\infty} a^{1/n} = 1, \qquad a > 0
$$
