A **real number** is, herustically, a number that could represent a measurement, which makes it the prototypical number system for many applications of math. The [[set]] of real numbers we denote $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbf{R}$.

We have [[binary operations|binary operation]] of $+, -, \times, \div$ and an inequality operator $\leq$.

# Completeness

The completeness axiom says that every non-empty [[subset]] of $\RR$ bounded above admits a supremum.

# Archimedean property

$$
\forall a> 0: \forall b > 0: \exists n \in \mathbb{N}: an > b
$$
