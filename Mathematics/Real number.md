A **real number** is, herustically, a number that could represent a measurement, which makes it the prototypical number system for many applications of math. The [[set]] of real numbers we denote $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbf{R}$.

We have [[binary operations|binary operation]] of $+, -, \times, \div$ and an inequality operator $\leqslant$.

# Completeness

The completeness axiom says that every non-empty [[subset]] of $\RR$ bounded above admits a supremum.

# Properties

Archimedean property
: For any real numbers $a$ and $b$, there is an integer $n$ such that $an > b$.
