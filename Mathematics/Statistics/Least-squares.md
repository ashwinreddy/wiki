In linear regression, the hypothesis $h$ looks like

\\[
h_\theta(x) = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x_1 + \theta_2 x_2
\\]

The $\theta_i$'s are parameters or weights. We can simplify the notation by defining $x_0 = 1$ and then specifying that $\theta$ is a (column) vector:

\\[
h(x) = \theta^\mathsf{T}x
\\]
