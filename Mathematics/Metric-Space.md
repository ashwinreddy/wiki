A **metric space** is an ordered pair $(M,d)$ where $M$ is a set and $d$ is a metric on $M$. A metric is a function $d: M \times M \to \mathbb{R}$ such that $\forall x, y, z \in M$,

1. $d(x,y) \geq 0$ (follows from the other three)
2. $d(x,y) = 0 \iff x=y$
3. $d(x,y) = d(y,x)$
4. $d(x,z) \leq d(x,y) + d(y,z)$

The metric induces a topology on the set.
