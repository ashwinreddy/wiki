The **gradient** of a scalar-valued function $f: \RR^n \to \RR$ is a [[vector]] that points in the direction of maximal ascent. Concretely, it is the collection of a functions [[partial derivatives|partial derivative]].

\begin{equation}
\left(\vec\nabla f\right)_i = \pdv{f}{x_i}
\end{equation}

For a Riemannian manifold, we write the gradient as the dual to the differential.

$$
\operatorname{grad} f \doteq \left( \dd{f} \right)^\sharp
$$
