The **gradient** of a scalar-valued [[function]] $f: \RR^n \to \RR$ is a [[vector field]] where the [[vector]] points in the direction of maximal ascent. Concretely, it is the collection of a functions [[partial derivatives|partial derivative]].

\begin{equation}
\nabla f(x) \triangleq \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1} \\\\\ \vdots \\\\\ \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_n} \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

For a [[Riemannian manifold]], we write the gradient as the dual to the [[differential form]] with a [[musical isomorphism]].

$$
\operatorname{grad} f \doteq \left( \dd{f} \right)^\sharp
$$
