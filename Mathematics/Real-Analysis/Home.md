Not every set has a maximum, therefore we introduce idea of [[infimum and supremum]], which are greatest lower bound and least upper bounds.

The completeness axiom for the real numbers tells us every non-empty subset of $\RR$ bounded above has a supremum.

The Archimedean property says for positive reals $a$ and $b$, there is always an integer $n$ such that $an > b$.
