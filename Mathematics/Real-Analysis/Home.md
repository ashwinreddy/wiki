Not every set has a maximum, therefore we introduce idea of [[infimum and supremum]], which are greatest lower bound and least upper bounds.

The completeness axiom for the real numbers tells us every non-empty subset of $\RR$ bounded above has a supremum.

The Archimedean property says for positive reals $a$ and $b$, there is always an integer $n$ such that $an > b$. You can always fill the pool with water by any spoon.

When we have a sequence of real numbers, we can consider the limit. A sequence converges / has a limit when for every $\epsilon > 0$, there is an $N$ such that $n > N \implies | s_n - s| < \epsilon$.
