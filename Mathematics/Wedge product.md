The **wedge product** is an operation that generates an oriented volume element from spanning vectors. Changing the order of the vectors introduces a change of sign in the result. 

\begin{equation}
a \wedge b \equiv - b \wedge a
\end{equation}

We then conclude that a vector can't span a volume with itself.

\begin{equation}
a \wedge a \equiv 0
\end{equation}


Supposing you have a vector space with basis elements $\left\\{e_i\right\\}$ it suffices to know the wedge products of the basis vectors.




In 2D, the wedge product is given by

\begin{equation}
a \wedge b = (\alpha_1 \beta_2 - \alpha_2 \beta_1) I
\end{equation}
