For a vector space $V$, the **dual vector space** $V^\ast$ is the homomorphism $\mathrm{Hom}(V, \mathbb{R})$. An element of $V^\ast$ is a covector w.r.t. the vector space $V$.

**Example**. If $p$ is an element of the vector space of polynomials, $I = \int_0^1 \mathrm{d}x$ is a covector.

The basis vectors for the dual space can be picked independently of the vector space. To be economical, we usually require that

\begin{equation}
\epsilon^a(e_b) = \delta^a_b
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\tilde{A_i} = \frac{\partial x^j}{\partial \tilde{x }^i}A_j
\end{equation}
