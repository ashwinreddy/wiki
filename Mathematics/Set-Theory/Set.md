A **set** is a collection or bag of objects $S$. Sets have no notion of order or repetition. The main operation on sets is a membership check: asking whether $x$ belongs to $S$. The notation $x \in S$ is true if $x$ belongs to $S$ and is false otherwise (we then write $x \not\in S$). From this, most other properties of sets can be derived.
