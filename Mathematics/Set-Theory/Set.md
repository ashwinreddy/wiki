A **set** is the weakest way to group a bunch of objects, with no notion of order or repetition. Two sets are equal if they contain the same objects

$$
A = B \iff (x \in A \iff x \in B)
$$

That leads us to [[subset]].

# Examples

* The [[empty set]]

# Properties

* The **cardinality** of a set is the number of (unique) elements it contains (since it forgets repeats).
