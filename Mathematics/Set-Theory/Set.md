A **set** is just a well-defined collection or bag of objects called members or elements. The fundamental operation of sets is checking membership. If $x$ is in A, we write $x \in A$; if $x$ is not in $A$, we write $x \not\in A$. A set has no notion of order or repetition. However, we can ask how many distinct objects are in $A$, which is called the cardinality of $A$ and denoted $|A|$.

A **subset** $B$ for $A$ is a set whose only elements are those that also belong in $A$. We write $B \subseteq A$. If $A$ has an element that $B$ does not have, we say $B$ is a proper subset, and say $B \subset A$.  Two sets are equal iff they are subsets of each other.
