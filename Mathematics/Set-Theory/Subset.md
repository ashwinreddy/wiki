A **subset** of a [[set]] $S$ is a set $A$ wholly contained in $S$. We write $A \subseteq S$ and use $A \subset B$ when we specifically mean to say that $A$ is a strict subset of $S$. Often, we can describe a subset using a set and a predicate which tests whether an element should belong to the subset, thereby filtering out the unwanted elements.
