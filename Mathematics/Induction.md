Proof by induction is a useful tool for proving that some predicate $P(n)$ holds for all $n \geq k$ for a $k \in \mathbb{N}$. Unlike proof by deduction, where the statement an can be proved axiomatically, induction relies on assumptions and recursion. As a result, we must first be moderately sure that what we are trying to prove is indeed true. In any case, a proof by induction has three steps:
