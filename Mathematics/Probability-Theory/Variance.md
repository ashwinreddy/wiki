The variance of a random variable is the covariance of the variable with itself. Concretely, a random variable $X$ with mean $\mu$ has variance

\\[
\operatorname{Var}[X] = \mathbb{E}\left[(X - \mu)^2\right]
\\]

\\[
\operatorname{Var}[X] = \mathbb{E}[X^2] - \mathbb{E}[X]^2 = \mathbb{E}[X^2] - \mu^2
\\]
