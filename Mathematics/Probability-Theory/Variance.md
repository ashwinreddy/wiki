The **variance** $\sigma^2$ of a [[Random variable]] $X$ is its second moment, or equivalently, the [[Covariance]] with itself.

$$
\sigma^2_X = \mathbb{V}[X] = \mathop{\mathrm{cov}}(X, X) = \mathbb{E}\left[\left(X - \mu_X \right)^2\right]
$$

$$
\mathbb{V}[X] = \mathbb{E}\left[X^2\right] - \mu_X^2
$$
