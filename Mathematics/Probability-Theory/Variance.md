The **variance** of a [[random variable]] $X$ is a measure of spread by seeing on average how far away $X$ is from its mean or [[expected value]] $\mu_X = \mathbb{E}[X]$. 

$$
\mathbb{V}[X] \doteq \mathbb{E}\left[\left(X - \mu_X\right)^2\right]
$$


# Computation

Computationally, it is more convenient to write

$$
\mathbb{V}[X] = \mathbb{E}\left[X^2\right] - \mu_X^2
$$

# Covariance

Variance is the [[covariance]] of a variable with itself.

\begin{equation}
\mathbb{V}[X + Y] = \mathbb{V}[X] + 2\operatorname{cov}(X, Y) + \mathbb{V}[Y]
\end{equation}

So that if $X$ and $Y$ are independent, the variance of sums is the sum of variances.


# Properties

* A variance is always non-negative: $$\mathbb{V}[X] \geqslant 0$$

* $$\mathbb{V}[\alpha X] = \alpha^2 \mathbb{V}[X].$$ In particular, this means that $\mathbb{V}[-X] = \mathbb{V}[X]$.

$$
\mathbb{V}[c + X] = \mathbb{V}[X]
$$

$$
\Pr(X = 0) \leqslant \frac{\mathbb{V}(X)}{(\mathbb{E}X)^2}
$$
