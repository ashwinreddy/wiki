A **probability density function (PDF/pdf)** is a [[function]] that assigns probability densities to a continuous [[random variable]].

$$
\text{Density} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Area}}
$$

We know that the total area is 1 by the Kolmogorov axioms, which puts a restriction:

$$
\int_{\RR} \varphi(x) \dd{x} = 1.
$$
