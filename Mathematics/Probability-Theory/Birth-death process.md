**Birth-death process** is a [[CTMC|continuous time Markov chain]]

Suppose $\lambda_i = \lambda$ and $\mu_i = \mu$. The balance equation tells us 

$$
\pi(k-1)\lambda - \pi(k)\mu = 0
$$


Then, the stationary distribution $\pi$ looks like

$$
\pi(k) = \left(1 - \frac{\lambda}{\mu}\right)\left(\frac{\lambda}{\mu}\right)^k
$$
