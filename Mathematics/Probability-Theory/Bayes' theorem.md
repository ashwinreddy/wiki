**Bayes' theorem** tells you how to update your prior beliefs given new information. Suppose you have a hypothesis. The prior is how likely you think this hypothesis to be true. You then observe some evidence. Bayes' theorem says that your new belief in the hypothesis, known as the posterior, is found by scaling the prior by a factor of the likelihood of seeing this evidence given the hypothesis divided by the probability you'd see this evidence anyway.

\begin{equation}
\text{Posterior} = \frac{\text{Likelihood}}{\text{Evidence}}\text{Prior}
\end{equation}


\begin{equation}
\Pr (A | B) = \frac{\Pr(B|A)}{\Pr(B)}\Pr(A)
\end{equation}
