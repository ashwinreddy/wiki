**Bayes' theorem** gives a way to find the probability of an event $A$ conditioned on event $B$ happening if we know the probability of $B$ happening given that $A$ happened.

$$
\overbrace{\Pr (A | B)}^{\text{posterior}} = {\overbrace{\Pr(B|A)}^{\text{likelihood}} \over \Pr(B)}\overbrace{\Pr(A)}^\text{prior}
$$
