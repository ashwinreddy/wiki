**Chebyshev's inequality** says that the probability a random variable is $k$ standard deviations away from its mean drops as $1/k^2$.

\begin{equation}
\boxed{\Pr \left( | X - \mu| \geq k\sigma \right) \leq \frac{1}{k^2}} \tag{Chebyshev's Inequality}
\end{equation}

For example, there is at most 10% chance that a value sits outside 3 standard deviations from the mean.
