A **Markov model** is a probabilistic model that assumes the [[Markov property]].

| |Observable|Partially observable|
|--|---------|--------------------|
|**Autonomous**|[[Markov chain]]|[[Hidden Markov model]]|
|**Controlled**|[[Markov decision process]]|[[Partially observable Markov decision process]]|

You can think of it as a infinite-length [[Bayes net]]
