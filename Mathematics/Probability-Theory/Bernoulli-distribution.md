A Bernoulli distribution is a discrete probability distribution modeling a possibly biased coin flip (i.e. a coin flip where heads has probability $p \in [0,1]$).

\\[
\Pr(X=x) = \begin{cases}p & x=1 \\\  1-p & x=0\end{cases}
\\]

This can be written in a single expression as

\\[
\Pr(X=x) = p^x (1-p)^{1-x},\quad x \in \\{0,1\\}
\\]
