**Multivariate normal distribution** generalizes the [[normal distribution]] to higher dimensions. We might also call this a **Gaussian vector** or **jointly Gaussian** [[random variable]].


$$
X = \mu_x + AW
$$

where $A$ is a full-rank matrix and $W$ is a column vector of [[iid]] [[standard normal]].
