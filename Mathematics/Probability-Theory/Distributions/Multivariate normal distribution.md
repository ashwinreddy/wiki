**Multivariate normal distribution** generalizes the [[normal distribution]] to higher dimensions. We might also call this a **Gaussian vector** or **jointly Gaussian** [[random variable]].


$$
X = \mu_x + AW
$$

where $A$ is an [[invertible matrix]] and $W$ is a column vector of [[iid]] [[standard normal|normal distribution#standard normal distribution]].

# Properties

* If $X$ and $Y$ are jointly Gaussian, the [[MMSE|minimum mean square error]] is the [[LLSE|Linear least squares estimation]]
