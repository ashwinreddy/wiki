A **normal distribution** or **Gaussian distribution** is a very common continuous distribution with parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma$ that control the mean and standard deviation. Possibly the simplest normal distribution to write down is

\begin{equation}
\varphi(x) = e^{-\pi x^2}
\end{equation}

The general form is a little more involved.

\begin{equation}
\varphi(x; \mu, \sigma) = {\over \sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} 
\end{equation}
