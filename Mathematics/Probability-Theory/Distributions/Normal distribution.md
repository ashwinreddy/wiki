A **normal distribution** or **Gaussian distribution** [[probability distribution]] is a very common continuous distribution with parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma$ that control the mean and [[standard deviation]]. Possibly the simplest normal distribution to write down is the one with 0 mean and variance $(2\pi)^{-1}$.

\begin{equation}
\varphi(x) = e^{-\pi x^2}
\end{equation}

The general form is a little more involved, with a [[normalizing constant]] of $1/\sqrt{2\pi}$. It is a [[Gaussian function]]

\begin{equation}
X \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2) \iff \varphi(x; \mu, \sigma) = {\exp\left( - \frac{1}{2\sigma^2}(x- \mu)^2 \right) \over \sigma \sqrt{2\pi}}   
\end{equation}

However, we can write $X$ using the standard normal $Z \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)$.

$$
\varphi_Z(z) = {\exp\left( - x^2 / 2 \right) \over \sqrt{2\pi}}   
$$

\begin{equation}
X = \mu + \sigma Z \iff Z = { X - \mu \over \sigma}
\end{equation}

Roughly 68% of the probability mass falls within 1 standard deviation of the mean.
