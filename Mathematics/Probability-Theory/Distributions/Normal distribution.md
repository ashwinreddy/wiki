A **normal distribution** or **Gaussian distribution** is a very common continuous distribution with parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma$ that control the mean and standard deviation. Possibly the simplest normal distribution to write down is

\begin{equation}
\varphi(x) = e^{-\pi x^2}
\end{equation}

The general form is a little more involved.

\begin{equation}
\varphi(x; \mu, \sigma) = {\exp\left( - \frac{1}{2\sigma^2}(x- \mu)^2 \right) \over \sigma \sqrt{2\pi}}   
\end{equation}
