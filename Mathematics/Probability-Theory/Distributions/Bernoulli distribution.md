A **Bernoulli distribution** represents a coin flip with a potentially biased coin with 1 and 0 instead of heads and tails. The distribution is parameterized by the probability of getting a heads $0 \leq \mu \leq 1$:

$$
f(o) = \begin{cases} \mu & o = 1 \\ 1-\mu & o = 0\end{cases}
$$



A cute write is

\begin{equation}
\Pr(X = o) = p^o (1-p)^{1-o}
\end{equation}
