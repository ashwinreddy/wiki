A **derived distribution** is a [[probability distribution]] for a [[random variable]] $Y = g(X)$ for $X$ a random variable. 

If you want the [[expected value]], you don't need to know the derived distribution; by [[LOTUS]],

$$
\mathbb{E}[Y] = \mathbb{E}[g(X)].
$$

For a discrete random variable,

$$
p_Y(y) = p_X(g^{-1}(y))
$$

if $g$ is [[invertible function]]
