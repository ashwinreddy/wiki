**Probability theory** is the mathematics of quantified uncertainty. The high level idea is that we have an [[experiment]] which results in a [[random variable]] quanity $X$, which tags the outputs (or a function of the output) with probabilities that describe how likely we are to see each value. This is the frequentist perspective that people usually hear when talking about probability. A probability is a percentage $p$ that tells you if you were to repeat the experiment $n$ times, that you would see that result $pn$ times, with the value getting closer and closer as you collect more samples, i.e. $n \to \infty$.

Thus, understanding probability allows us to incorporate the uncertainty and give concrete numerical results without the need for actually repeating the experiment, which is costly and can only give us an approximation to the real answer.
