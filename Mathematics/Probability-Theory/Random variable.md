**Random variables (RV)** are the building block of probability. An RV represents the the outcome of an experiment, with outcomes tagged with probabilities. The random variable can take on discrete or continuous outputs. Mathematically, we treat $X$ as if it is any other mathematical object, but when we want to know a probability, we make use of its probability mass function (pmf) or probability density function (pdf).

\begin{equation}
\Pr(X = x) = \begin{cases} p_1 & x= x_1 \\\\ \vdots & \vdots \\\\ p_n & x = x_n \end{cases}
\end{equation}
