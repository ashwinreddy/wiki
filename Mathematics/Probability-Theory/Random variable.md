**Random variables (RV)** are the building block of probability. Simply put, they represent a discrete or continuous quantity (more technically, the outcome of an [[experiment]]) whose value is uncertain. Mechanically, the variable tags possible outcomes with probabilities.

We can query the probability of an event occuring by making use of the random variable's [[probability mass function]] (pmf) or [[probability density function]] (pdf). 

Suppose $X$ can take on values $x_1, \dots, x_n$. Then,

\begin{equation}
\Pr(X = x) = \begin{cases} p_1 & x= x_1 \\\\ \vdots & \vdots \\\\ p_n & x = x_n \end{cases}
\end{equation}

Formally, $X$ is a function.
