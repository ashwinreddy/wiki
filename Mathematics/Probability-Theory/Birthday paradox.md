The **birthday paradox** is about the suprisingly high rate of growth of probability that any two people in a room of $n$ share a birthday with respect to $n$. 


We assume every birthday is equiprobable. The sample space has size $365^n$ since each person can have any birthday. But we are only in the permutations of the 365 will we have _different_ birthdays for everyone. The complement of our event is

$$
\bar{p}(n) = \frac{ \_{365}P_{n} }{365^n}
$$
