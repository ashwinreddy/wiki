&gt; For proposition $A$  and evidence $B$, the degree of belief in $A$ having accounted for $B$ is the initial degree of belief in $A$ scaled by the support $B$ provides for $A$.

\begin{equation}
\boxed{\overbrace{\Pr(A | B)}^{\text{posterior}} = \frac{\Pr(B | A)}{\Pr(B)}\overbrace{\Pr(A)}^{\text{prior}}}
\end{equation}
