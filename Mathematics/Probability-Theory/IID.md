**Independent and identically distributed (IID / i.i.d.)** means that a set of [[random variables|random variable]] are independent from each other but are all drawn from the same distribution. In essence, this enables a factorization

\begin{equation}
\Pr(X_1 = x_1, \dots, X_n = x_n) = \prod_{i} \Pr(X_i = x_i)
\end{equation}

where the actual probability will depend on the distribution in question.
