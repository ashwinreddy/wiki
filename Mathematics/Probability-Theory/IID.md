**Independent and identically distributed (IID / i.i.d.)** means that a [[set]] of [[random variables|random variable]] are enjoying [[independence]] from one another other but are all drawn from the same [[probability distribution]] $f$. In essence, this enables a factorization

\begin{equation}
\Pr(X_1 = x_1, \dots, X_n = x_n) = \prod_{i=1}^n f(x_i)
\end{equation}

where the actual probability will depend on the distribution in question.
