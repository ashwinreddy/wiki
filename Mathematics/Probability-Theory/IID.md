**Independent and identically distributed (IID / i.i.d.)** means that a [[set]] of [[random variables|random variable]] enjoy [[independence]] from one another other and are all drawn from the same [[probability distribution]] $f$. In essence, this enables a factorization

\begin{equation}
\Pr\left(\bigcap_{i=1}^n X_i = x_i\right) = \prod_{i=1}^n \Pr(x_i).
\end{equation}
