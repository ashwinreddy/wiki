The **law of large numbers (LLN)** is a theorem that deals with [[convergence of random variables]] for an empirical average.

# Weak Law

> The empirical mean of i.i.d. random variables $X_i$ [[converges in probability|convergence of random variables]] to the [[expected value]] of $\mathbb{E}(X)$:

\begin{equation}
\lim_{n \to \infty} \Pr\left( \left| \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n X_i - \mathbb{E}X \right| \geqslant \epsilon \right) = 0. \tag{WLLN}
\end{equation}

# Strong

The empirical mean of pairwise independent and identically distributed random variables with finite mean converges to the true mean [[almost surely|almost sure convergence]].
