**Almost sure** is a kind of [[convergence of random variables]]. We say $X_n a \overset{p}{\to} b X$ almost surely if

$$
\Pr \left(\lim_{n \to \infty} X_n = X\right) = 1,
$$

so that as functions $X_n \to X$ converge pointwise. We say _almost_ surely because you can imagine an example like a dartboard. Landing a dart on the exact diagonal happens with probability 0, so it almost surely will not happen (part of the sample space, but has probability 0).

$$
\text{Almost sure convergence} \implies \text{Convergence in probability} \implies \text{Convergence in distribution}
$$
