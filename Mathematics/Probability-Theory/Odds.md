**Odds** are an alternate way of describing probability. Suppose you're interested in event $p$ whose complement has probability $q$. Then, the probability is $\frac{p}{p+q}$ whereas the odds are simply $p: q$.

@10.5555/1146355 describes $a$-for-1 and $b$-to-1 odds. In $a$-for-1 odds, you put down 1 dollar before the game, and win $a$ dollars if you're right and nothing otherwise. With $b$-to-1 odds, you pay 1 dollar if you lose and gain $b$ dollars if you win.
