A **probability mass function (PMF / pmf)** a.k.a **the distribution** of a discrete [[random variable]] $X$ is a [[function]] $p : \mathbb{R} \to [0,1]$ assigns probability.

\begin{equation}
p_X (x) = \Pr(\\{X = x\\}) =  \mathbb{P}(\\{\omega : X(\omega) = x\\})
\end{equation}

The conditions for the function are that

\begin{gather}
p_X(x) \geq 0 \\\\\ \sum_x p_X(x) = 1
\end{gather}

You could imagine the pmf as a vector.
