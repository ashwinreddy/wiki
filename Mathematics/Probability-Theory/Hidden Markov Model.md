A **Hidden Markov model (HMM)** models a [[sequence]]

is a kind of [[Markov model]] where we have observations $O$ and hidden variables/states $Q$. We have transition probabilities, which tell us the probability from moving state to state and observation probabilities that tell us the probability of an observation given a state.
