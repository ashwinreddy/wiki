**Independence** means [[event]] $A$ and $B$ have no bearing on each other.

$$
\mathbb{P}(A \cap B) = \mathbb{P}(A)\mathbb{P}(B)
$$

<<Warn("This does not mean the events are disjoint: $A \cap B = \emptyset$.")>>

If $\mathbb{P}(B) > 0$, then $A$ and $B$ are independent iff $\mathbb{P}(A \mid B) = \mathbb{P}(A)$.
