**Conditional independence** describes situations where an observation is is irrelevant. $A$ and $B$ are conditionally independent of some event $C$ if
$$
\mathbb{P}(A, B \mid C) = \mathbb{P}(A \mid C) \cdot \mathbb{P}(B \mid C).
$$

We write $ \perp\\!\\!\\!\perp$

# Example

Let $A$ be the event of a random person being lactose intolerant and $B$ is the event that he is shorter than average. A famous study showed that $\mathbb{P}(A \mid B) \gg \mathbb{P}(A)$. Does that mean lactose intolerance is caused by height? No, because if you condition on $C$ being the event that a person is of Asian descent, then the data makes sense.
