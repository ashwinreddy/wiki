**Conditional independence** for events $A$, $B$, and $C$ with $\mathbb{P}(C) > 0$ satisfy

$$
\mathbb{P}(A \cap B \mid C) = \mathbb{P}(A \mid C) \mathbb{P}(B \mid C).
$$

We say $A$ and $B$  are conditionally independent given $C$.

# Example

Let $A$ be the event of a random person being lactose intolerant and $B$ is the event that he is shorter than average. A famous study showed that $\mathbb{P}(A \mid B) \ggt \mathbb{P}(A)$
