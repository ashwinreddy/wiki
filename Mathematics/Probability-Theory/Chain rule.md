The **chain rule** equates a joint probability distribution with a factorization of purely conditional distributions. In two variables,

\begin{equation}
\Pr(X, Y) = \Pr(X \mid Y) \cdot \Pr(Y)
\end{equation}

In many,

\begin{equation}
\Pr\left( \cap \right) = \Pr(X \mid Y) \cdot \Pr(Y)
\end{equation}
