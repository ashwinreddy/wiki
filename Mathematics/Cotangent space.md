The **cotangent space** $T_p^* M$ is the [[dual vector space]] to the [[tangent space]] on a [[manifold]]. 

\begin{equation}
T\_p^\*M \triangleq (T\_pM)^*
\end{equation}

Its elements are cotangent vectors, functions of the form

\begin{equation}
\alpha: T_p M \to F
\end{equation}

# Basis

Suppose we have a coordinate system for $T_p M$ given by $\\{\pdv{}{x^i}\\}$
