Precomposition with a function probably provides the most elementary notion of pullback: in simple terms, a function f of a variable y, where y itself is a function of another variable x, may be written as a function of x. This is the pullback of f by the function y.
$$
f(y(x)) \equiv g(x) \implies (f\circ y) = g
$$

In differential geometry,

the pullback allows us to take, for example, a surface in ambient space $\mathbb{R}^3$ can be defined parametrically by two parameters $u$ and $v$. We want to integrate the surface, so pullback to R2.
