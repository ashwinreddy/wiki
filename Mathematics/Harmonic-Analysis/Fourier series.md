The **Fourier series** decomposes a signal into a superposition of sines and cosines and represents a way of converting from time domain to frequency domain.

$$
{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}a_{n}&={\frac {2}{P}}\int _{P}s(x)\cdot \cos \left(2\pi x{\tfrac {n}{P}}\right)\,dx\\b_{n}&={\frac {2}{P}}\int _{P}s(x)\cdot \sin \left(2\pi x{\tfrac {n}{P}}\right)\,dx.\end{aligned}}}
