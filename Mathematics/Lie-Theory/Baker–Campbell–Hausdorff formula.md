The **Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula** describes how to compose elements of a [[Lie algebra]] $X$ and $Y$ that correspond to elements $g$ and $h$ of a [[Lie group]]. The formula tells us that

\begin{equation}
gh = e^X \circ e^Y = e^{X + Y + \frac{1}{2}[X, Y] + \frac{1}{12} [X, [X, Y]] - \frac{1}{12} [Y, [X, Y]] + \dots }
\end{equation}

where the $[,]$ represents the [[Lie bracket]].

> Near the identity in $G$, group multiplication in $G$ can be expressed as [[exponential map]] $e^X$ for small $X$ in $\mathfrak{g}$.
