The **Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula** describes how to combine elements of a [[Lie algebra]]. Suppose we have two elements of a [[Lie group]] $G$, labeled $g$ and $h$. Further suppose that $X$ and $Y$ are elements of the [[Lie algebra]] that correspond to $g$ and $h$. The formula tells us that

\begin{equation}
gh = e^X \circ e^Y = e^{X + Y + \frac{1}{2}[X, Y] + \frac{1}{12} [X, [X, Y]] - \frac{1}{12} [Y, [X, Y]] + \dots }
\end{equation}
