For a [[matrix Lie group]], the **matrix Lie algebra** is given by those $n \times n$ [[square matrices|square matrix]] $X$ such that the [[matrix exponential]] $e^{tX} \in G$ for $t \in \RR$ with the [[Lie bracket]] $[X,Y]=XY-YX$. 

Informally, an element $x$ of the algebra is associated with a perturbation $1 + \epsilon x + O(\epsilon^2)$ on the group.
