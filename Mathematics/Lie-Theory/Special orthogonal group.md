The **special orthogonal group** $\operatorname{SO}(n)$ is the [[subgroup]] of the elements of the general [[orthogonal group]] $\operatorname{O}(n)$ with [[determinant]] 1. Elements of $SO(n)$ are path-connected while elements of $O(n)$ are not.


$SO(3)$ is the [[3D rotation group]].

There is a 2-to-1 [[homomorphism]] from [[SU(2)]] $SU(2)\times SU(2) \to SO(4)$
