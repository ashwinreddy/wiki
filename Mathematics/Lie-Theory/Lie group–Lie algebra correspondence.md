A **Lie groupâ€“Lie algebra correspondence** allows one to study a [[Lie group|Lie group]] $G$ in terms of an appropriate [[Lie algebra|lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$.[^caveat] The long and short of it is that $\mathfrak{g}$ is the [[tangent space]] $T_eG$ where $e$ is the identity on $G$. 


[^caveat]: _N.B._ The Lie algebra does not always entirely capture the group because different groups can have the same algebra.
