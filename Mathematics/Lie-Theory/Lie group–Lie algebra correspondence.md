A **Lie group–Lie algebra correspondence** allows one to study [[Lie groups|Lie group]] in terms of [[Lie algebras|lie algebra]].

For a [[Lie group]] $G$, the algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ is the [[tangent space]] $T_eG$ where $e$ is the identity on $G$. The Lie algebra does not always entirely capture the group because different groups can have the same algebra.
