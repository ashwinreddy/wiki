The **orthogonal group** $O(n)$ is the [[group]] of [[$n\times n$ matrices|square matrix]] that are [[orthogonal|orthogonal matrix]]. It is a [[subgroup]] of the [[general linear group]].

\begin{equation}
\operatorname{O}(n) \subset \operatorname{GL}(n)
\end{equation}

# [[Lie algebra]]

The Lie algebra consists of [[skew-symmetric matrices|skew-symmetric matrix]]. First, we look at $T_e O(n)$ where $e$ is the [[identity matrix]]. Let $A(t)$ be a smooth path going through the identity.
