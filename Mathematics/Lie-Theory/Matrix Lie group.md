A **matrix Lie group** is a [[Lie group]] of $n \times n$ [[matrices|matrix]] closed under products, inverses, and nonsingular limits. This includes most interesting Lie groups, but they are easier to handle.


# Properties


* The [[general linear group]] $\operatorname{GL}(n, F)$ is the largest matrix Lie group.
