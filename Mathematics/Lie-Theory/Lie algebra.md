A **Lie algebra** is a [[vector space]] with a [[Lie bracket]] operation. 


Ideal
: An ideal $\mathfrak{h}$ is a subspace of $\mathfrak{g}$ [[closed|closure]] under [[Lie bracket]] with every member of $\mathfrak{g}$.

# Matrix Lie algebra

For a [[matrix Lie group]], the matrix Lie algebra is given by those $n \times n$ [[square matrices|square matrix]] $X$ such that the [[matrix exponential]] $e^{tX} \in G$ for $t \in \RR$ with the [[Lie bracket]] $[X,Y]=XY-YX$.
