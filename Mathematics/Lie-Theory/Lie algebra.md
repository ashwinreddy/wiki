A **Lie algebra** is a [[vector space]] with a [[Lie bracket]] operation. 


Ideal
: An ideal $\mathfrak{h}$ is a subspace of $\mathfrak{g}$ [[closed|closure]] under [[Lie bracket]] with every member of $\mathfrak{g}$.

Abelian Lie algebra
: An abelian Lie algebra is one where the bracket $[x,y] \equiv 0$
