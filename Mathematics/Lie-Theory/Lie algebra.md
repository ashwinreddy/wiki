A **Lie algebra** is a [[vector space]] with an alternating bilinear operator $[-,-]: V \times V \to V$ satisfying the Jacobi identity called the **Lie bracket**. Lie algebras on their own are not very interesting: a vector space can be furnished into a Lie algebra just by setting up the trivial bracket (i.e. $[x,x] = 0$). Instead, we're interested in Lie algebras that correspond to Lie groups.

# Lie group-Lie algebra correspondence

Given a Lie group $G$, a useful Lie algebra for $G$ comes from equipping $T_e G$ with the right bracket.

# Homomorphism

A **Lie algebra homomorphism** is a linear map between Lie algebras that is compatible with the Lie bracket.
