A **Lie algebra** helps us solve problems relating to a [[Lie group]]. In terms of structure, a Lie algebra is a [[vector space]] with an operation known as the [[Lie bracket]]. For a [[Lie group]] $G$, the algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ is the [[tangent space]] $T_eG$ where $e$ is the identity on $G$. 

# Matrix Lie algebra

For a [[matrix Lie group]], the matrix Lie algebra is given by those $n \times n$ [[square matrices|square matrix]] $X$ such that the [[matrix exponential]] $e^{tX} \in G$ for $t \in \RR$ with the [[Lie bracket]] $[X,Y]=XY-YX$.
