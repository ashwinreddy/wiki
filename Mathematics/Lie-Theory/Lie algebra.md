A **Lie algebra** is a [[vector space]] with an alternating bilinear operator $[-,-]: V \times V \to V$ satisfying the Jacobi identity called the **Lie bracket**. Lie algebras on their own are not very interesting: a vector space can be furnished into a Lie algebra just by setting up the trivial bracket (i.e. $[x,x] = 0$). Instead, we're interested in Lie algebras that correspond to Lie groups.
