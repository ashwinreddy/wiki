A **Lie algebra** helps us solve problems relating to a [[Lie group]]. In terms of structure, a Lie algebra is a vector space with an operation known as the [[Lie bracket]]. For a [[Lie group]] $G$, the algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ is the [[tangent space]] $T_eG$ where $e$ is the identity on $G$. For a [[matrix Lie group]], the algebra is given by those $n \times n$ matrices $X$ such that the [[matrix exponential]] $e^{tX} \in G$ for $t \in \RR$. 


# Examples

Let's find the Lie algebra of the [[3D rotation group]] $SO(3)$.
