The **3D rotation group** is the [[Lie group]] of rotations in three-dimensions, denoted $\operatorname{SO}(3)$. It consists of matrices $O$ such that 

\begin{equation}
O^\mathsf{T}O = I \tag{Orthogonality}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\det O = 1 \tag{Special Condition}
\end{equation}

# [[Lie algebra]]

The Lie algebra is $\RR^3$ with the [[cross product]].
