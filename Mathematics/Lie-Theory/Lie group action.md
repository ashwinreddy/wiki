A **Lie group action** is the [[group action]] specified in the Lie theory context. Given Lie group $G$ and manifold $M$, the action is a map $G\times M \to M$. 

Any Lie group can act on itself. Fix an $a \in G$ to create left and right translation actions

\begin{gather}
L_a(g) = ag \\\\\
R_a(g) = ga
\end{gather}

By the principles of group theory, the actions are just cycling all the elements in the group. This means we can translate the tangent space at any point to the identity. 

\begin{equation}
TG \cong G \times T_e G
