The **circle group** $\mathbb{T}$ is a [[Lie group]]. Its elements are the set of points on a unit circle with group action as rotation. Because of its simplicity, it can be represented in a variety of equivalent ways.

\begin{equation}
\mathbb{T} \cong \operatorname{SO}(2) \cong \operatorname{U}(1)
\end{equation}

# SO(2)

SO(2) is a [[one-parameter group]] given by

\begin{equation}
R(\theta) = \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & -\sin\theta \\\\\ \sin\theta & \cos\theta \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

because $R(\alpha + \beta) = R(\alpha)R(\beta)$.
