The **exponential map** is a [[function]] from a [[Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$ to its [[Lie group]] $G$. Its signature is

\begin{align}
\exp: \mathfrak{g} &\to G
\end{align}

It provides a [[diffeomorphism]] between a neighborhood of 0 in $\mathfrak{g}$ and a neighborhood of $e$ in $G$.


For a [[matrix Lie group]], it's just the [[matrix exponential]].
