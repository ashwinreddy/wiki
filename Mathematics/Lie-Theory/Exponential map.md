The **exponential map** is a [[function]] that is a "delinearization" portal from a [[Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$ to its [[Lie group]] $G$:

\begin{align}
\exp: \mathfrak{g} &\to G \\\\
X &\mapsto \exp(X) = \gamma(1)
\end{align}

where $\gamma: \RR \to G$ is the unique [[one-parameter subgroup]] of $G$ whose [[tangent vector]] at the identity is $X$.

For a [[matrix Lie group]], this happens to be the [[matrix exponential]].
