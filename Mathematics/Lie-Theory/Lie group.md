A **Lie group** is a [[topological group]] $(G, \cdot)$ where the topology is a [[smooth manifold|differentiable manifold]]. A Lie group can be [[well understood|Lie groupâ€“Lie algebra correspondence]] by a [[Lie algebra]].

A locally Lie group (i.e. group operations are smooth near the origin) is necessary and sufficient to be a Lie group.[^tao]
