A **Lie group** is a [[group]] $(G, \cdot)$ that is also a [[smooth manifold|differentiable manifold]] with the multiplication map and inverse map (from the group) smooth. A Lie group can be [[well understood|Lie groupâ€“Lie algebra correspondence]] by a [[Lie algebra]].

A locally Lie group (i.e. group operations are smooth near the origin) is sufficient to be a Lie group.[^tao]
