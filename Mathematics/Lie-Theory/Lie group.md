A **Lie group** $(G, \cdot)$ is a differentiable [[manifold]] with [[group]] structure. The compatability between these two abstractions is enforced by demanding that group multiplication and inversion are smooth. Every group can be made into a Lie group by giving it the discrete topology, so we usually focus on connected groups.

The simplest interesting example of a Lie group is probably the [[circle group]].

Every Lie group $G$ has a [[Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$ that we can use to help understand the group better.

# Tangent space

The key idea of a [[Lie algebra]] is that knowing the tangent space gives you most of the information about the group.

# Matrix Lie groups

A **matrix Lie group** is any closed subgroup of the general linear group. They form an important collection of Lie groups. The Lie algebra is given by computing the matrix exponential of $tX$ for every $X$ in the group.
