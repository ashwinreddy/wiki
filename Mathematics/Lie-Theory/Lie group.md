A **Lie group** is a group $(G, \cdot)$ that is also a [[smooth manifold]] with the multiplication map and inverse map (from the group) smooth. Let the [[category]] of Lie groups be LieGrp.

# Examples

* $(\RR^n, +)$
* [[special unitary group]] $SU(2)$
* [[unitary group]] $U(1)$
* [[general linear group]] $\operatorname{GL}(n, \RR)$
