A **Lie group** $(G, \cdot)$ is a differentiable [[manifold]] with [[group]] structure. The compatability between these two abstractions is enforced by demanding that group multiplication and inversion are smooth.

The simplest interesting example of a Lie group is probably the [[circle group]].

Every Lie group $G$ has a [[Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$ that we can use to help understand the group better.
