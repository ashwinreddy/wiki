The **tensor product** for [[vector spaces|vector space]] $V$ and $W$ is denoted $\otimes$ and returns outputs in a composite vector space.

$$
\otimes: V \times W \to V \otimes W
$$

The basis for $V \otimes W$ if $V$ has basis $e_i$ and $W$ has basis $f_j$ is the set of $e_i \otimes f_j$.




The simple product of $v \otimes w$ is given by storing the multiplication of every element of $v$ with every element of $w$.

$$
v \otimes w = vw^\mathsf{T}
$$
