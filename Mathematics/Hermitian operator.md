A **Hermitian operator** is a self-adjoint operator, one that is its own [[Hermitian adjoint]].

# Quantum Mechanics

Hermitian operators are important in quantum mechanics. In quantum mechanics, we think of a Hermitian operator $Q$ as one for which any $\mid \Psi \rangle$,

$$
\langle \hat{Q} \Psi \mid \Psi \rangle = \langle \Psi \mid \hat{Q} \Psi \rangle
$$

1. A Hermitian operator has real eigenvalues only.
2. Eigenvectors for a Hermitian operator coming from different eigenvalues are orthogonal.

For any Hermitian operator $Q$, the eigenstates of $Q$ are the unique states with

$$
Q | \Psi \rangle = q | \Psi \rangle \iff \sigma_Q = 0 .
$$

Thus, [[stationary states|stationary state]] (eigenstates of [[Hamiltonian]]) are ones with definite energy.
