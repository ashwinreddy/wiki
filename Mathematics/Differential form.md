A **differential $k$-form** is something you can integrate over a $k$-dimensional manifold. For example, a differential 1-form in $n$-dimensional space is an expression of the form

\begin{equation}
f_1 \dd{x_1} + \dots + f_n \dd{x_n}
\end{equation}

The set of differential $k$-forms is denoted by $\bigwedge^k (T_p^* M)$, meaning exterior powers of the [[cotangent bundle]].
