A **differential $k$-form** is something you can integrate over a $k$-dimensional manifold. The set of differential $k$-forms is denoted by $\bigwedge^k (T_p^* M)$, meaning exterior powers of the [[cotangent space]].

# Differential one-form

A differential one-form in local coordinates is written

\begin{equation}
\alpha(x) = \alpha_1(x)\,\dd{x}_1 + \dots + \alpha_n(x) \dd{x}_n
\end{equation}
