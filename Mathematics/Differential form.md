A **differential $k$-form** is something you can integrate over a $k$-dimensional manifold. The set of differential $k$-forms is denoted by $\bigwedge^k (T_p^* M)$, meaning exterior powers of the [[cotangent bundle]].

\begin{equation}
\dd{x}\_i\left( \pdv{}{x_j} \right) = \delta_{ij}
\end{equation}
