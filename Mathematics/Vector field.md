A **vector field** assigns [[tangent vectors|tangent vector]] to points on a [[manifold]] $M$. This defines the signature as manifold to tangent bundle.

\begin{equation}
F: M \to TM
\end{equation}

But we also need to ensure that $F(p)$ for a point $p \in M$ belongs to its tangent space. Consider $p$ a projection from $TM$ to $M$ that takes a tangent vector to its point. $F$ must also satisfy

\begin{equation}
p \circ F = \operatorname{id}
\end{equation}

Shortcircuiting the mathematical construction, a vector field maps open subsets of $\RR^n$ to $\RR^n$ once a choice of coordinates has been imposed.

# Notation

The set of vector fields on a manifold is often denoted $\mathfrak{X}(M)$ or $\Gamma(TM)$.
