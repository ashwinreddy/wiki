The **eigenfunction** for a linear operator $D$ is a [[function]] $f$ that satisfies for some constant $\lambda$,

$$
Df = \lambda f
$$

The key example is finding the eigenfunction of the [[derivative]].

$$
\dv{}{t} f(t) = \lambda f(t)
$$

This is a simple [[differential equation]], solved by the [[exponential function]]

$$
f(t) = e\^{\lambda t)
$$
