A [[topological space]] $(M,\mathcal{O})$ is called a $d$-dimensional manifold if for all points on the manifold, there's a subset of the topology such that the subset can map into a subset of $\mathbb{R}^d$ continuously and invertibly (with the inverse being continuous as well).

\\[
\forall p \in M: \exists U \in \mathcal{O}: \exists \overbrace{x: U \to x(U)}^\text{chart map} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d
\\]

and $x$ is invertible, continuous and $x^{-1}$ is continuous.
