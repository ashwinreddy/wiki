A **coordinate system** or **chart** for a [[manifold]] $X$ is a [[homeomorphism]] between [[Cartesian space]] and the manifold. Since the inverse of a homeomorphism is itself a homeomorphism, the domain and codomain don't matter so long as the choice is fixed. But when we consult a map we typically ask, "where is $x\in X$ located?"

$$
\phi: X \supset U \to V \subset \RR^n
$$

A chart need not be [[surjective|surjection]] (i.e. cover the whole manifold), in which case the coordinates only make sense locally.
