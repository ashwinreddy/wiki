A **coordinate system** or **chart** for a [[manifold]] $X$ helps map out part of the manifold (possibly all of it) using [[Cartesian space]]. The chart is a [[homomorphism]] between [[open subsets|open subset]] of the space.[^order]



$$
\phi: X \supset U \to V \subset \RR^n
$$



[^order]: Since the inverse of a homeomorphism is itself a homeomorphism, the domain and codomain don't matter so long as the choice is fixed. But when we consult a map we typically ask, "where is $x\in X$ located?"
