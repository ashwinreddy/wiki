A **coordinate system** or **chart** for a [[manifold]] $X$ is a [[homeomorphism]] between [[Cartesian space]] and the manifold. Since the inverse of a homeomorphism is itself a homeomorphism, the domain and codomain don't matter so long as the choice is fixed. Personally, we will go with the order $X \to \RR^n$ because we usually think to ask of a map, "where is $x$ located?"

$$
\phi: \RR^n \to X
$$

A chart need not be [[surjective|surjection]] (i.e. cover the whole manifold), in which case the coordinates only make sense locally.
