A **coordinate system** or **chart** for a [[manifold]] $X$ helps map out part of the manifold (or possibly even all of it) using Cartesian space. The chart is a homomorphism between open subsets of the two spaces.[^order]



$$
\phi: X \supset U \to V \subset \RR^n
$$

For example, if $X$ is the earth, then $\phi(\text{Paris})$ could be the latitude and longitude of Paris.

[^order]: Since the inverse of a homeomorphism is itself a homeomorphism, the domain and codomain don't matter so long as the choice is fixed. But when we consult a map we typically ask, "where is $x\in X$ located?"
