A **topological space** is a [[set]] $X$ with a topology $\tau$ such that

1. $\tau$ contains $X$ and the empty set.
2. Arbitrary unions of $\tau$ are in $\tau$
3. The intersection of any two members of $\tau$ are in $\tau$


A common example would be the [[real number]] line $\RR$ with every open interval as the topology.
