A topological space is a set of points $X$ along with chosen neighborhoods $N(x)$ for subsets $x \in X$ that satisfy:

* Every element $x \in X$ is in its own neighborhood
* Every superset of a neighborhood of a point is also a neighborhood
* The intersection of two neighborhoods of a point is itself a neighborhood of the point
* Any neighborhood $N$ for a point $x$ includes a neighborhood $M$ such that $N$ is a neighborhood of each point of $M$.
