An **atlas** $\mathscr{A}$ collects [[charts|coordinate system]] into a complete map, known as an [[open cover]], for a [[manifold]]. When we're interested in a [[differentiable manifold]], we have to check the transition maps.


# Transition Maps

Transition maps are wrapped inside the abstraction of an atlas and hopefully do not become leaky. The idea is that you have two charts that overlap somewhere:

$$
U_{ij} = U_i \cap U_j
$$
