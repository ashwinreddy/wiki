An **atlas** is a collection of charts which map the whole [[topological manifold]]. 

# Types

The maximal atlas contains all possible charts.

An atlas can be $\diamondsuit$-compatible if any two charts in it are $\diamondsuit$-compatible. Two charts are $\diamondsuit$-compatible if where they overlap, the chart transition maps are $\diamondsuit$-compatible. We can have $C^k$ or $D^k$ or $C^\omega$, etc. compatabilities.
