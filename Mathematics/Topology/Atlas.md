An **atlas** $\mathscr{A}$ collects [[charts|coordinate system]] into a complete map, known as an [[open cover]], for a [[manifold]]. When we're interested in a [[differentiable manifold]], we have to check the transition maps.


# Transition Maps

Transition maps are wrapped inside the abstraction of an atlas and hopefully do not become leaky. The idea is that you have a chart $(U_\alpha, \tau_\alpha)$ and $(U_\beta, \tau_\beta)$
