A **chart** $(U,\varphi)$ is a [[homeomorphism]] $\varphi$ from an open subset $U$ of $M$ to an open subset of a Euclidean space. A vector does not change under a change of chart. The $\varphi^i$ are the coordinate maps.

# Compatability

Two charts (U, x) and (V,y) are compatible if $U \cap V = \emptyset$ or if the relevant transition map and its inverse are compatible in some sense.

So for example if the map and its inverse are differentiable, the charts are differentially compatible.
