A **chart** $(U,\varphi)$ is a homeomorphism $\varphi$ from an open subset $U$ of a manifold $M$ to an open subset of a Euclidean space. A vector does not change under a change of chart. The $\varphi^i$ are the coordinate maps.


A chart is a [[homeomorphism]] that maps coordinate neighborhoods of points on an $n$-dimensional manifold to a subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$.
