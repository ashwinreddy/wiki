A base (or basis) B for a [[topological space]] X with [[topology]] T is a collection of open sets in X such that every open set in X can be written as a union of elements of B. We say that the base generates the topology T. Bases are useful because many properties of topologies can be reduced to statements about a base generating that topology, and because many topologies are most easily defined in terms of a base which generates them.
