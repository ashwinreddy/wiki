A **manifold** (abbr. mfd) is a [[topological space]] than can be [[charted|coordinate system]] into more familiar Cartesian space using an [[atlas]]. Think of them as locally open subsets of Euclidean space $\RR^n$ where you can change coordinates as you like.



For example, a [[circle|circle group]] is a manifold.

# Orientability

A manifold is orientable if the atlas has transition functions with positive [[determinant]].
