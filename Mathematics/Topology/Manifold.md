A **manifold** (abbr. mfd) is a [[topological space]] than can be [[charted|coordinate system]] into more familiar Cartesian space using an [[atlas]]. 

> Manifolds can for the most part be thought of locally as open subsets of a Euclidean space $\RR^n$ in which one has the freedom to change coordinates as one desires.



For example, a [[circle group]] is a manifold.
