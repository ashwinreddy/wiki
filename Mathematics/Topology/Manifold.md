An $n$-dimensional manifold $M$ is a topological space that locally resembles $\RR^n$ near each point.

A coordinate chart is an injective map $\phi: U \to V$ where $U$ is an open set in $M$ and $V$ is an open set in $\RR^n$.

An atlas on $M$ is $\\{(U_\alpha, \phi_\alpha)\\}$ with

* $\bigcup_{\alpha} U_\alpha = M$
* The charts are sewn together with transition functions

Consider an element of $P \in U_\alpha \cap U_\beta$ with a representation $P_\alpha$ in $U_\alpha$ and $P_\beta$ in $U_\beta$.

$$
P_alpha = \phi_\alpha(P) = \phi_\alpha \circ \phi_\beta^{-1}(P_2)
$$
