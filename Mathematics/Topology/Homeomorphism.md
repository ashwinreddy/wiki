A **homeomorphism** is a function $f:X \to Y$ between two [[topological space]]s with the following properties:

- $f$ is a bijection
- $f$ is continuous
- $f^{-1}$ is continuous

Homeomorphisms are the structure-preserving maps for topologies, that is if there is a homeomorphism, the two topological spaces are (topologically) isomorphic.

Examples:

- The graph of a differentiable function is homeomorphic to the domain of the function.
