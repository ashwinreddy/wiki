A **topological manifold** is a topological space $(X, \tau)$ if for every point $p \in X$ there's a **chart map** for every open set. 

A chart map is a function $x$ that maps an [[open set]] $U$ containing $p$ into $\RR^d$ and $x$ and $x^{-1}$ are continuous (using the inherited topology on $U$ and standard topology on $\RR^d$).
