A **topological manifold** is a topological space $(X, \tau)$ if every point is charted.

Chart map
: A function $x$ that maps an [[open set]] $U$ containing $p$ into $\RR^d$ with $x$ and $x^{-1}$ continuous (using the inherited topology on $U$ and standard topology on $\RR^d$).

The chart is recorded as $(U, x)$.
