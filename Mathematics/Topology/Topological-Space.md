A **topological space** is an ordered pair $(X, \tau)$, where $X$ is a set and $\tau$ is a collection of subsets of $X$, satisfying the following axioms:

1. The empty set and $X$ itself belong to $\tau$.
2. Any arbitrary (finite or infinite) union of members of $\tau$ still belongs to $\tau$.
3. The intersection of any finite number of members of $\tau$ still belongs to $\tau$.

The elements of $\tau$ are called open sets and the collection $\tau$ is called a topology on $X$.

**Example**. Pick $\tau = \\{X, \emptyset\\}$. Then, $(X, \tau)$ is the indiscrete space or codiscrete space and $\tau$ is the trivial toplogy.
