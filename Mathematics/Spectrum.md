A **spectrum** in functional analysis is the set of eigenvalues for an operator $Q$.

# Quantum Mechanics

A discrete spectrum means physically realizable states with eigenfunctions in Hilbert space. A continuous spectrum means non-normalizable eigenfunctions, which cannot possibly represent wave functions.
