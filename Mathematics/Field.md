A **field** is a set on which two binary operators addition and multiplication are defined so that 

a) both operations are commutative
b) are associative
c) that multiplication distributes over addition
d) that addition and multiplication have neutral/identity elements
e) that addition and multiplication have inverse elements

Examples:

- rational numbers
- real numbers
- complex numbers

Every field is a [[ring]].
