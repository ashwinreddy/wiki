A **field** is a [[set]] on which two binary operators addition and multiplication are defined so that 

- both operations are commutative
- are associative
- that multiplication distributes over addition
- that addition and multiplication have neutral/identity elements
- that addition and multiplication have inverse elements

Examples:

- rational numbers
- real numbers
- complex numbers

Every field is a [[ring]].
