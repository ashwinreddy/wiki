**Jensen's inequality** says that for a [[convex function]] $\varphi$, the function evaluated at the [[expected value]] of [[random variable]] cannot overestimate the average value of the function.

\begin{equation}
\boxed{\varphi\big( \mathbb{E}[X] \big) \leqslant \mathbb{E}\big[\varphi\left(X\right)\big]}
\end{equation}

> If a collection of masses $p_i$ are placed on a convex curve $f(x)$ at locations $(x_i,f(x_i))$, then the centre of gravity of those masses, which is at $(\mathbb{E}[x],\mathbb{E} [f(x)])$, lies above the curve.

The inequality is reversed if $\varphi$ if [[concave function]].
