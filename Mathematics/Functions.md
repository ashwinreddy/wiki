# Introduction

A function is an [ordered triple](./Sets#set-operations_cartesian-product) $(f, A, B)$. It is usually easier to write $f: A \to B$. $A$ is the domain, and $B$ is the codomain. The set of possible outputs is the range.

# Types of Functions

- surjective means that the codomain and range are the same. In other words, the function can map onto its codomain completely.
- injective means that no two inputs give the same output
- bijective means that there's a way to connect every element in the domain with the codomain without any crosses
