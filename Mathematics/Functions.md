A function is an [ordered triple](./Sets#set-operations_cartesian-product) $(f, A, B)$. It is usually easier to write $f: A \to B$. $A$ is the domain, and $B$ is the codomain. The set of possible outputs is the range, necessarily a subset of the codomain or the codomain itself.

## Types of Functions

- surjective means that the codomain and range ar
