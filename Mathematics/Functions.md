# Introduction

A function is an [ordered triple](./Sets#set-operations_cartesian-product) $(f, A, B)$. It is usually easier to write $f: A \to B$. $A$ is the domain, and $B$ is the codomain. The set of possible outputs is the range.

# Types of Functions

- surjective means that the codomain and range are the same. In other words, the function can map onto its codomain completely.
- injective means that no two inputs give the same output
- bijective means that there's a way to connect every element in the domain with the codomain without any crosses

# Inverse Function

\begin{equation}
(f^{-1}\circ f)(x) = x
\end{equation}

A function can only have an inverse if it is injective.

# Parametric Curves/Equations

For example,

\begin{equation}
x = \cos{t} \qquad y = \sin{t}
\end{equation}

determines a circle in $\mathbb{R}^2$
