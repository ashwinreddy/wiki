The **tangent bundle** is a [[bundle]]. As a set,


\\[
TM \equiv \bigsqcup_{p\in M}T_pM
\\]


Intuitively, of a differentiable manifold $M$ is the collection of [[tangent space]]s on $M$ by [[disjoint union]]:

\begin{align}
\pi : TM &\to M \\\
X &\mapsto p
\end{align}

where _p_ is the unique point _p_ $\in$ M: $X \in T_pM$.

We pick the coarsest topology on TM that is the coarsest topology such that $\pi$ is just continuous.
