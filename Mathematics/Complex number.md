A **complex number** is a number of the form $a+ b \iota$ where $\iota = \sqrt{-1}$. The complex numbers naturally describe the 2D plane as [[Euler's formula]] allows us to use them both for polar and Cartesian coordinates. In addition, their algebra means that a complex number "encodes" a rotation through multiplication.

# Matrix Construction

Since $a + b\iota$ is just a linear combination of two vectors, we should be able to represent it using an appropriate 2-dimensional vector space. 

\begin{equation}
a + b \iota = \begin{bmatrix}a & -b \\\\\ b & a\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
