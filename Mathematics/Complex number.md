A **complex number** is a number of the form $a+ b \iota$ where $\iota = \sqrt{-1}$. The complex numbers naturally describe the 2D plane as [[Euler's formula]] allows us to use them both for polar and Cartesian coordinates. In addition, their algebra means that a complex number "encodes" a rotation.
