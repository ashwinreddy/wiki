The **derivative** of a single-variable function $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is a function denoted $f'$ or $\dv{f}{x}$ that measures the sensitivity of the output to the input at a point. 

\begin{equation}
\dv{f}{x} \triangleq \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \frac{f(x + \epsilon) - f(x)}{\epsilon}.
\end{equation}

The derivative can be numerically approximated by picking small $\epsilon$ such as 0.01 .
