As [Tao](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~tao/preprints/forms.pdf) points out, **integration** refers to different concepts:

1. The indefinite integral
2. The unsigned definite integral
3. The signed definite integral

Integration doesn't have a formula in general. Techniques include:

* [[integration by substitution]]
* [[integration by parts]]
