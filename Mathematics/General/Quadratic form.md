A **quadratic form** is a [[polynomial]] with only terms of degree two over any number $n$ variables. A quadratic form can be written in terms of a [[symmetric matrix]].

$$
q_A(\vec{x}) = \vec{x}^\mathsf{T}A\vec{x}
$$

# Formal definition

A quadratic form over a [[field]] $k$ is a map $q: V \to k$ for finite dimensional [[vector space]] $V$ over $k$ such that

$$
q(x) = \langle x | A | x \rangle
$$
