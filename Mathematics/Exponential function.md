The **exponential function** is most naturally defined by its Maclaurin series.

\begin{equation}
\boxed{
\exp(x) \triangleq \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{x^k}{k!} = \left(\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{k!}\right)^n
}
\end{equation}

It is generalized to the [[matrix exponential]]

# Differential Equation

The exponential function has the unique property of being its own derivative.
