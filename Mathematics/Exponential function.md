The **exponential function** is naturally defined by its Maclaurin series. [This website](https://setosa.io/ev/exponentiation/) gives a good sense for exponential growth. It is generalized to the [[matrix exponential]]

\begin{equation}
\ref{eq:defn}
\boxed{
\exp(x) \triangleq \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{x^k}{k!}
}
\end{equation}
