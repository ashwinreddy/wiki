The **exponential function** is a [[function]] most naturally described as a [[Maclaurin series|Taylor series]].

\begin{equation}
e^x \doteq \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{x^k}{k!}
\end{equation}

This definition extends to complex numbers, quaternions, and matrices.

However, it is most intuitively described by compound interest at infinite frequency

\begin{equation}
e^x = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left(1 + \frac{x}{n}\right)^n
\end{equation}

Its inverse is the [[logarithm]]

# Properties

\begin{equation}
\exp\left(\sum_i x_i\right) = \prod_i \exp {x_i}
\end{equation}
