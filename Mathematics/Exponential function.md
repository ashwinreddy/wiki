The **exponential function** is most naturally described as a Maclaurin series

\begin{equation}
e^x \triangleq \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{x^k}{k!}
\end{equation}

This definition extends to complex numbers, quaternions, and matrices.

However, it is most intuitively described by compound interest at infinite frequency

\begin{equation}
e^x = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left(1 + \frac{x}{n}\right)^n
\end{equation}

# Extensions

The Maclaurin series is natural because it extends to [[complex numbers|Euler's formula]] and [[matrices|matrix exponential]].
