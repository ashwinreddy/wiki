The **exponential function** is most naturally defined by its Maclaurin series.

\begin{equation}
\boxed{\exp(x) \triangleq \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{x^k}{k!}}
\end{equation}

It is generalized to the [[matrix exponential]]

# Differential Equation

$$
\dv{y}{t} + \alpha y = 0 \implies y = y_0 \exp(-\alpha t)
$$
