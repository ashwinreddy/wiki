A **function** is a mapping between two sets that only returns one output for a given input.

# Classifications

Injective
  : A function where the output can be traced back to its input without ambiguity
  
Surjective
  : A function which fills its codomain (i.e. the image is the codomain)
  
Bijective
  : A function which is both injective and surjective
