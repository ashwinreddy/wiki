A **function** is a machine that produces an output when given an input. Formally, it is a [[binary relation]] that represents a mapping, a rule that associates every input/source element with an output/target element. We restrict the relation so that every element in the domain gets mapped and gets mapped to exactly one element.

\begin{align\*}
f: \mathsf{Domain} &\to \mathsf{Codomain} \\\\\
x &\mapsto y = f(x)
\end{align\*}

We call $x$ the independent variable and $y$ the dependent variable.

The domain is a [[set]], and so is the codomain.
