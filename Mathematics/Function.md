A **function** is a mapping between two [[set]]s that only returns one output for a given input.

# Classifications

Injective
  : A function where the output can be traced back to its input without ambiguity. $f(x)=f(y)\implies x = y$.
  
Surjective
  : A function which fills its codomain (i.e. the image is the codomain)
  
Bijective
  : A function which is both injective and surjective

Periodic
  : A function for which $\exists \, T > 0: f(t+T)=f(t)$

# Methods

Support
  : A function's support is the set of inputs that result in a nonzero output
  
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{supp}\left(f\right) = \\{x \in X | f(x) \neq 0 \\}
\end{equation}
