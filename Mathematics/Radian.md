A **radian** is a unit of angle defined such that $2\pi$ is a full rotation. Why is this a useful definition? Consider the equation

$$
s = r \theta
$$

where $\theta$ is an angle measured in radians and $r$ is the radius of a circle. Then, $s$ is the arclength covered since the circumference is given by

$$
C = \pi d = 2\pi r
$$
