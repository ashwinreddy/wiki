An **atlas** consists of charts that describe regions of a [[manifold]]. For a topological space $M$, the atlas is a collection $\\{(U_\alpha, \varphi_\alpha) \vert \alpha \in A\\}$ such that $\bigcup_{\alpha \in A}U_\alpha = M$

# Chart

A chart is a homeomorphism $\varphi$ from an open subset $U$ of $M$ to an open subset of a Euclidean space. The chart is $(U,\varphi)$.

# Transition Map

\begin{equation}
\tau_{\alpha,\beta} = \varphi_\beta \circ \varphi_{\alpha}^{-1}
\end{equation}

All three are homeomorphisms.
