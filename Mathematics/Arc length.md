**Arc length** is the [[functional]] giving the distance between points on a [[curve]]. A simple formulation would be the [[integral]] of [[speed]] to get distance.

$$
L = \int_a^b \dd{s}
$$

$$
\dd{s} = \lVert \dot{\gamma}(t) \rVert \dd{t}
$$

In two dimensions, we have then

$$
\dd{s} = \sqrt{\dd{x}^2 + \dd{y}^2}
$$
