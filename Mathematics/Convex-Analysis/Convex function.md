A **convex function** (which we can think of as having a shape like $\smile$) is an easy-to-minimize [[function]]. It is sublinear on all intervals.

$$
f\big(\alpha x + (1-\alpha)y \big)\leq \alpha f(x) + (1-\alpha)f(y), \quad \alpha \in I
$$

[[Jensen's inequality]] applies to convex functions.

# Examples

* $x^2$, $e^{x}$, and $e^{-x}$
* $-\log x$ and $x \log x$
