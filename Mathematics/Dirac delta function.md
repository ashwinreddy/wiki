The **Dirac delta function** $\delta$ is defined as

$$
\delta(x) = \begin{cases} +\infty & x= 0 \\\\\ 0 & x \neq 0\end{cases}
$$

with its [[integral]]

$$
\int_\RR \delta(x - x_0)\\,\dd{x} = 1.
$$

$$
\int_\RR \delta(x)f(x) \\,\dd{x} = f(0)
$$

We can think of it as a [[normal distribution]] with [[variance]] $\sigma^2 \to 0$. [[Kronecker delta]]
