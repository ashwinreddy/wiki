The **cross product** is an operation $\times: \RR^3 \times \RR^3 \to \RR^3$ that takes two [[vectors|vector]] $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$ and generates a vector that is [[orthogonal]] to them and has length equal to the area spanned by them.

\begin{equation}
(\vec{a} \times \vec{b})^i = \epsilon_{ijk}a^j b^k
\end{equation}

We can also compute a cross product by taking the first argument and turning it into a [[skew-symmetric matrix]]:

\begin{equation}
\left[\vec{a}\right]_\times = \begin{bmatrix}0 & -a_3 & a_2 \\ a_3 & 0 & -a_1 \\ -a_2 & a_1 & 0\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
