**Partial fraction decomposition or expansion (PFD/PFE)** is taking a rational expression and turning it into a sum of simpler rational expressions.

$$
X(s) = \frac{N(s)}{D(s)} = \frac{b_m s^m + \dots + b_0}{a_ns^n + \dots + a_0}
$$

So $m$ is the degree of numerator and $n$ for the denominator.

|$m=n$|proper rational function|
|$m>n$|improper rational function|
