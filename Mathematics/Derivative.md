The **derivative** is a measure of local (around a point $a$) rate of change for a function. This can be computed by letting a little bit of "time" pass at $a$ and measuring the change over that interval:

\begin{equation}
f'(a) = \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h}
\end{equation}

These values can then be collected over the entire function, giving us a new function

\begin{equation}
\dv{f}{x} = f'(x)
\end{equation}
