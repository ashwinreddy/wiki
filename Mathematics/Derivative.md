The **derivative** is a measure of local (around a point $a$) rate of change for a function. An example that is familiar to everyone is velocity $v$ as the derivative of position $x(t)$. This can be computed by letting a little bit of "time" $\Delta t$ pass at a time $t$ and measuring the change over that interval:

\begin{equation}
v(t) = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0}\frac{x(t+ \Delta t) - x(t)}{\Delta t}
\end{equation}

From this formula, Leibniz came up with the notation

\begin{equation}
v = \dv{x}{t}
\end{equation}
