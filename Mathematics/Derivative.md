# Types of Derivatives

For single variable functions, the standard definition of a derivative is 

$$
y'(x) = \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{y(x+h)-y(x)}{h}
$$

A partial derivative generalizes the same notion in the case that a function takes in multiple inputs.

$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i} = \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{f(x_1,\dots,x_i+h,\dots,x_n)-f(x_1,\dots,x_i,\dots,x_n)}{h}
$$
