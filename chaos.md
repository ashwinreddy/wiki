chaos is the primordial force of disorder which wears many masks:

> uncertainty; variability; imperfect, incomplete knowledge; chance; [[chaos]]; volatility; disorder; [[entropy]]; [[time]]; the unknown; randomness; turmoil; stressor; error; dispersion of outcomes; unknowledge. -- [[antifragile]]

For [[deleuze]] and [[guattari]], it's a little different.

> Chaos is defined not so much by its disorder as by the infinite speed with which every form taking shape in it vanishes. It is a void that is not a nothingness but a _virtual_, containing all possible particles and drawing out all possible forms, which spring up only to disappear immediately, without consistenty or reference, without consequence. Chaos is an infinite speed of birth and disappearance.  -- [[what is philosophy?]]

for the pair, [[science]], [[philosophy]], and [[art]] are different responses to chaos. 

Chaos is also a staple of [[literature]]. It appears in [[metamorphoses]] and [[paradise lost]] explicitly and implicitly in [[the dark knight]], for example.
