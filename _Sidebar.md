The philosophy behind this repository is to hold a set of detailed reference notes on technical subjects. Guidelines:

1. **Articles should be readable.** Bold the main word when it first shows up, write definitions of objects in the form class + differentiation. Practice good mathematical notation. Use headers as needed.
2. Avoid **page creep**. Don't expand a concept into its own article until needed.
