the event.

[[deleuze]] gave a lecture on the event in 1987, something which interested him back in _[[difference and repetition]]_ and _[[logic of sense]]_. In _Gilles Deleuze: Key Concepts_, James Williams argues that Deleuze's lecture was itself an event, but how? It might seem strange to quote Deleuze "everything is an event," or that every event participates "in a single and same Event." Yes, everything is an event, but the kicker is this: different events draw out these qualities more than others. 

an event is a process, knowing no limits and connecting to every other event, and a [[singularity]]. An event is a far-reaching transformations through novelty. Some events, however, repress their transformation and change, clinging to identity and sameness -- the same lesson repeated every year in front of different yet equally bored classes. A lesson as experiment, sensitive to the variety and potential in each participant, though, that is an event that jolts itself and others into greater change and at higher intensity.

deleuze starts the lesson with _on travaille_, an event because it is a happening, a communal new work, the drawing together of shared yet different powers. 

Examples of events: a garden, a chair, the great pyramid, a collision with a bus, Adam sinning, a concert. Of course, we agree that an accident, a growing plant, a crumbling edifice or a bifurcation due to a fateful decision are events. But take a chair, a garden, the Great Pyramid over a fixed period, Adam once he has sinned: these are events too. For [[alfred north whitehead]], they are "many." For [[bergson]], they are durations. For [[leibniz]], they are vibrations and harmonics. The identity assigned is a cloak over many indivisible processes. 

> A chair, anything whatsoever, is an event as the harmony of multiple processes of becoming.

> Deleuze's account of the event can be seen as an unrelenting critique of the role of substance, traceable back to Aristotle, and an effort to state that events are modes, nothing but modes, a proposal coming out of a witches' brew of [[spinoza]] and [[nietzsche]]: Spinoza without substance and Nietzsche as speculative metaphysician. 

Deleuze wants his idea to be consistent with physics, noting that speculative philosophy can also scrutinize the metaphysical presuppositions of physical theories.

Event
: Mutliple events entering into harmonious resonance through vibrations between multiple series.

> There is divergence because the genesis of the event as convergence depends on prior multiple disjunctions of series, the divergent many in any event. These disjunctions are not only the genetic condition for the event. They live on in the event, making any event a fragile and passing harmony of convergence and divergence. The event is then a disjunctive many that enters into harmony without losing the disjunctive processes conditioning its emergence. The chair event, or the pyramid event, or the concert event brings together many different series by relating them. In reality, any of these events brings together the infinity of all series. Each event is the whole of the world from a singular perspective.

A concert is a coming together of the lives of audience and artists, and it does not disappear for them afterward. They will take from it different things and were brought together differently. The concert brings together these perspectives as an event.

> The event is openness and chance in the present. It is guided by the future and the past, not assumed as burdens, but welcomed as gifts to be worthy of.
