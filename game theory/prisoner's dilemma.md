You and I are questioned separately about some joint crime. The outcomes would be these. 
 
| | You confess | You stay silent |
|-|--------------|----------|
|**I confess**| Each gets 10 years | I go free, you get 12 years |
|**I stay silent** | I get 12 years, you go free | Each gets 2 years |

Cooperating, we both stay silent to minimize punishment. But if you confess, I prefer to confess because I serve 10 years and not 12. If you stay silent, I still prefer to confess beause I serve 0 years and not 2. Hence, I should always confess, and, by symmetry, you too. Thus, since we cannot cooperate, we each have to make an independent choice, and we rat each other out.
