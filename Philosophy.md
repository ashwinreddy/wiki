The purpose of this repository is to 

* help me connect ideas from different disciplines in one place
* to aid myself in learning by capturing my current understanding
* serve as a reference for the future, and 
* store useful bits of information and ideas that I come across. 

The original goal was to emulate a wiki. One person cannot reasonably manage this task and it provides very little value when wikis already exist. As such, there are [[guidelines]] to ensure that the wiki remains useful and stays true to the goals outlined above. Ideas in here may be wrong, and that's okay! The idea is to help myself think critically.

**N.B.** This wiki is primarily for myself and may not make sense or apply to others.
