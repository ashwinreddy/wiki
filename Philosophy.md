The primary purpose of this repository is to help consolidate my understanding of various ideas from different disciplines in one place, both to aid myself in learning and to serve as a reference for the future. The goal is not to emulate a wiki both because one person cannot reasonably manage this task and because it provides very little value when wikis already exist. As such, there are [[guidelines]] to ensure that the wiki remains useful and stays true to this philosophy. Ideas in here may be wrong, and that's okay! The idea is to help myself think critically.

**N.B.** This wiki is primarily for myself and may not make sense or apply to others.
