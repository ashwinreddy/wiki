multiplicity is a [[concept]] developed by [[deleuze]] and [[bergson]]. intensive vs. extensive multiplicity depends on intensive vs. extensive [[difference]]. An extensive multiplicity is a multiplicity of some distinct, generalized, and bounded body (collections of things, bodies, numbers, qualities, species).

> An intensive multiplicity is not a multiplicity of an identifiable measure; it is a substantive multiplicity. What it _is_ is an effect of its connections (or its becoming-multiple).
