In _History as Literature_, Theodore Roosevelt asks whether history is a [[science]] or a [[literature]]. He agrees that historians must do their due diligence in careful and painstaking researching. They must be steeped in science, which tells us about [[human]]'s place in nature. But, he argues, a historian needs a good imagination to put the facts together into a coherent unity, and such works as these are the ones that leave a mark. Beyond being a good writer, "the greatest historian should also be a great moralist."
