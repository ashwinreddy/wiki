A **tachymeter** is a scale on the ring of an analog watch with a chronograph. The tachymeter tells you at the $t$ second mark how many times an event would happen in an hour if it happened in $t$ seconds.

$$
{1 \text{ event}\over t\text{ seconds}} = {T \text{ events}\over 1\text{ hour}} \implies T = \frac{3600}{t}
$$

Basically, you can tell how many mph you're going if you use the tachymeter to go one mile.
