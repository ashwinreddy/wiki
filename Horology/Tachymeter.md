A **tachymeter** on a watch is a [[frequency]] scale/measure. At each time $t \in [0s, 60 s]$, the tachymeter value at that time is

\begin{equation}
T = \frac{3600}{t}
\end{equation}

If you start an event at the 0 mark and you look at the value after the event, the tachymeter basically tells you how many times that event will happen in an hour.

You can use a tachymeter to measure speeds and distances! To measure speed, move a fixed distance, say, 1 mile and read off the time. That's how many miles you will go in an hour. In this way, you can tell when a mile has passed by seeing when you hit that same number again.
