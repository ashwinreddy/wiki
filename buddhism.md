buddhism is a religion and [[philosophy]] started by Siddhartha Gautama, the [[buddha]]. Buddhism has much to say about [[consciousness]] among other things. 

[[vervaeke]] reads the first noble truth not as the idea that one is always in pain but as the fact that the threat of self-deception always looms over us. 

There are the Mahayana and Theravada schools.
