The cooperative principle (Grice's maxims) in [[pragmatics]] is the set of assumptions or directives which undergird [[conversation]] as an activity of [[cooperation]].  

1. Be informative.
2. Be truthful.
3. Be relevant.
4. Be clear and brief.

It's easier to see the rules in the transgression. When someone gives a knowingly obtuse answer to a question, lies about something banal, abruptly changes the conversation, or rambles incoherently, we are confused, annoyed, or taken aback.
