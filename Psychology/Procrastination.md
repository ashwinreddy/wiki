**Procrastination** is the delay of a task.

BJ Fogg's model of behavior is encapsulated by

$$
\text{Behavior} = \text{Motivation} + \text{Ability} + \text{Trigger}
$$

To encourage the behavior now (i.e. avoid procrastination), we can

* Build motivation - make it clear what the purpose of the activity is
* Adjust ability - focus on small, easy steps; break down the problem, or create a timeline.
* Trigger the action - create a cue to start the work
