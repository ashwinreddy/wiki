friedrich wilhelm nietzsche (1844-1900) was a philosopher from germany. in 1869, at the age of 24, he became a professor. his first book was _The Birth of Tragedy_, published in 1872, about greek tragedies. In _[[beyond good and evil]]_ (1886), nietzsche points out that philosophers have assumed an equality between truth and the good. he developed a kind of proto-[[existentialism]] and [[process philosophy]] by attacking [[christianity]]. 

[[deleuze]] sees nietzsche's project as introducing sense and value into philosophy. nietzsche sees himself as the "first tragic philosopher" and tries to go back to pre-socratics like [[heraclitus]]. He is opposed to decadence and _ressentiment_. 

In _[[genealogy of morals]]_ and _[[will to power]]_, nietzsche develops the idea of active and reactive forces. 

nietzsche sees [[play]] as cosmic.

He was (somewhat unfairly) connected to Nazism. 

He said [[god]] is dead. 

nietzsche was planning to write a book called [[homer]]'s Contest (_homers wettkampf_)
