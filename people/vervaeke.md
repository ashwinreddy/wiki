john vervaeke is a professor of cognitive science at the university of toronto. he has developed a theory called Relevance Realization, which is explained in his excellent lecture series on YouTube called [Awakening from the Meaning Crisis](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLND1JCRq8Vuh3f0P5qjrSdb5eC1ZfZwWJ). 

His interest started in the connection between Buddhism and Cognitive Science, especially in terms of [[mindfulness]]. He associates this with increasing interest in [[wisdom]], psychedelics, [[stoic]], and [[meaningness]]. He wants to provide the [[explanation]] for this. He thinks there is a Meaning Crisis, associated with Environmental Crisis and Socio-Economic Crisis. 

Vervaeke thinks of himself as part of a tradition of [[zen]] [[neoplatonism]]. For that reason, key figures for him are [[socrates]], [[plato]], [[buddha]], and the [[kyoto school]]. But he is also deeply influenced by [[spinoza]]. 

He comes from a background in fundamentalist [[christianity]].
