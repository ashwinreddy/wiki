plato was a philosopher from athens, a disciple of [[socrates]]. 

Following [Sadler's advice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X72ELQFnjYU). 

## [[deleuze]]

As mentioned in _deleuze's philosophical lineage_, Deleuze says in [[difference and repetition]] and the first appendix of [[logic of sense]] the task of philosophy is the _renversement_ of [[platonism]], which created an image of thought, a transcendent representation of Idea at the cost of difference in itself. But it is here, where he has made Plato an enemy, that Deleuze will also make him his ally.
