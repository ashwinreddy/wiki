georg wilhelm friedrich hegel (1770-1831) was a German Philosopher. He was influenced by [[kant]]. 

Unlike Kant, he sees no reason to talk about the thing-in-itself. So whatever is real is rational. We can understand the progression of [[history]] as a logical [[dialectic]]. Hegel himself isn't the one who uses the thesis-antithesis-synthesis vocabulary (apparently, that's [[fichte]] and [[Schelling]]), but that's the high-level idea. 

One could put him in with [[mysticism]]. 

Hegel says the subject matter of religion is "God and nothing but God," even for [[buddhism]] where he says "nothing" is the supreme. But he uses substance, essence, God, etc. to talk about Buddhism when it is incompatible with those concepts (this comes from Byung Chul-Han).
