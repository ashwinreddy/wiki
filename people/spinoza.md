baruch[^names] spinoza (1632-1677) was a philosopher who wrote _tractatus theologico-politicus_ and _[[ethica]]_. because he didn't believe in the traditional religion of his time, he was cast out of amsterdam's jewish community in 1656. spinoza's thinking was clearly influenced by [[descartes]]. 

spinoza learned [[latin]] and he had a copy of _[[metamorphoses]]_. 


[[deleuze]] says Spinoza was accused of materialism, immoralism, and atheism.  

_materialist_. Through his idea of parallelism, Spinoza puts the body and mind on equal terms. But Spinoza invites us to take the body as a model. The body surpasses our knowledge of it, so too does thought surpass our consciousness of it. We only know the effects of what happens to our body or happens to our mind, we're not in the position to say what the direct causes are. So Adam imagines himself happy and perfect from the illusion of final causes, free decrees, and theology. Consciousness will take effects for causes, it will invoke its power over the body, and it will invoke God where it cannot imagine itself to be the first cause or organizer of ends. 

_immoralist_. spinoza, like [[nietzsche]] doesn't have good and evil, but he does have good and bad. It is good when a body compounds its relation with ours and increases our power with all or part of its own. The primary, objective meaning of good is _agrees with our nature_. The individual is good that joins with what agrees to his nature, combines his relations, and increases his power. Goodness is dynamism, power, composition of powers. So what we call Evil, illness, and death are just bad encounters, poisioning, intoxication, relational decomposition. In Spinoza's world, Ethics > Morality. Morality is about transcendent value structures, the judgement of God, system of judgement. The illusion of consciousness is the illusion of values. 

_atheist._ Spinoza denounces the man with sad passions, the man who exploits them / needs them for power, and the man who is saddened by human condition and passions. The slave, the tyrant, and the priest. Sad passion joins cupidity to superstition; the slave and tyrant both hate life.

[^names]: From Nader's _Think Least Of Death_: "Bento was his given name in the Portuguese-Jewish community of Amsterdam. Baruch was the Hebrew name used in the synagogue, and Benedictus is the Latin version of his name that appears in his published writings. All three names mean 'blessed.'"
