leibniz was a philosopher who also did work in mathematics and physics. he worked on [[monad]]s. His motto is _calculemus_ ([[latin]] for let us calculate). he believed in the principle of sufficient reason ([[causation]]). 

[[deleuze]] thinks that leibniz is the person to reach for when asking, _[[what is philosophy?]] what does a philosopher grapple with?_ of course, for deleuze, the answer is that they create [[concept]]s.
