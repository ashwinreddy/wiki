immanuel kant (1724 - 1804) was a philosopher from prussia. He was deeply influenced by [[christianity]]. He was inspired by [[hume]]. He wrote _[[critique of pure reason]]_, _Critique of Practical Reason_.

For Kant, there is a realm of _phenomena_ or apperances and then a _noumenal_ realm behind it, beyond space and time. They are bridged by judgement and even aesthetic [[play]]. 

He asks _how should one act?_
