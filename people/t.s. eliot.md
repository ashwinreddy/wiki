### shakespeare and the [[stoic]]ism of [[seneca]]

> i propose a shakespeare under the influence of the stoicism of seneca. but i do not believe that shakespeare was under the influence of seneca... i wish mereley to disinfect the senecan shakespeare before he appears. my ambitions would be realized if i could prevent him, in so doing, from appearing at all.

eliot says shakespeare probably read seneca's tragedies but not his prose.
