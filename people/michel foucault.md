michel foucault was a philosopher who used the technique of [[genealogy]]. In [[technologies of the self]], he says 

> My objective for more than twenty-five years has been to sketch out a history of the different ways in our culture that humans develop knowledge about themselves: economics, biology, psychiatry, medicine, and penology. The main point is not to accept this knowledge at face value but to analyze these so-called sciences as very specific "truth [[game]]s" related to specific techniques that human beings use to understand themselves. 


Foucault wrote an intro to a book by [[deleuze]] and books about [[Sex]]. His influences include [[heidegger]] and [[nietzsche]] and [[marx]].
