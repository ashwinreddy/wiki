jordan peterson (1962-) is a professor of psychology from canada. 

peterson's mother is a librarian, and he studied in a great books program (source needed). A majority of Peterson's philosophy comes straight out of the [[literature]] and Philosophy of the [[Western canon]], which he recommends to people. For example, he often cites or talks about the [[bible]], which he has lectured on, in many of his discussions. His thought more generally is rooted in [[christianity]]. He likes to use examples like [[paradise lost]] or [[dostoevsky]]. Naturally, the fact that he's so entrenched in this mode of thought draws him into problems in the criticism of [[literature]].

As a result, he attacks Relativism and Postmodernism (which he also associates with [[marxism]]), especially [[michel foucault]] and [[jacques derrida]], whom he doesn't seem to have read. 

In psychology, Peterson has studied alcohol abuse, [[personality]], and [[myth]]. His influces include [[freud]], [[carl jung]], [[nietzsche]]. He talks about the [[oedipus complex]] a lot. 

One of the questions that drives Peterson is how [[Ideology]] led to [[fascism]] (i.e. [[Nazism]] in Germany) and Communism in Russia. 

He is also interested in responses to relativism, [[nihilism]], and [[existentialism]]. 

Peterson's philosophy is roughly inside [[pragmatism]], [[phenomenology]], [[Individualism]]. Although he uses [[science]] (he likes arguments from [[evolution]]), he says we don't always act like it's true. We need narratives to guide us. He thinks everybody has [[god]] as the top of their value of hierarchies. 

Peterson believes [[capitalism]] is the only economic solution that works because the Pareto distribution is common in nature. 

Peterson has engaged in dialogues with [[zizek]] and [[vervaeke]].
