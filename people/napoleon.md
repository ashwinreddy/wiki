napoleon was the French emperor after the [[french revolution]]. He was influenced by [[julius caesar]] and [[alexander the great]]. There's an interesting question to be asked about his connection to the [[enlightenment]]. [Apparently](https://shannonselin.com/2015/02/napoleon-like-read/ ), he liked to read [[plutarch]] and [[goethe]] and [[homer]], etc.
