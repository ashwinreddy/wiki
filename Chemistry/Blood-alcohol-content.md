**Blood alcohol content** is the number of grams of ethanol per 100 mL of blood. 

|BAC|Effect|
|----|------|
|0.01|Threshold intoxication|
|0.04|Relaxation, behavioral disinhibition, impaired judgement|
|0.08|Legally intoxicated, reaction time and coordination impaired|
|0.15|Gross intoxication, balance and movement impaired|
|0.30|Loss of consciousness|
|0.40|Approximate Human LD-50|

Of course, these are all influenced by tolerance.


Because alcohol is volatile, it will be breathed out from, which enables the use of breathalyzers.
