# Groups

|Name|Chemical Formula|Picture|Notes|
|----|----------------|-------|------|
| Hydroxyl | $\ce{-OH}$ | [[https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/d0f2df15737d3feeaeea4cf4ec640413c493a875.png]] | This group is polar due to electronegative oxygen, which also allows for hydrogen bonds with water. Thus, it can help dissolve compounds like sugars. Typically, compounds with a hydroxyl group are alcohols. |
|Carbonyl| $\ce{C=O}$ | [[https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/c599e439d6d70c9056d48931515740f81119c1a2.png]] | A ketone is a carbonyl on a central atom. An aldehyde is a carbonyl on a terminal atom. Sugars with ketones are ketoses, sugars with aldehydes are aldoses. |

## Carboxyl





Aldehyde is a carbonyl on a terminal atom.

Ketone is a carbonyl on a central atom.

Double bonds acn be opened up for rxns:

aldehydes that are sugars are aldoses

ketose is a ketone that is a sugar
