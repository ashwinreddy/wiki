|Name|Compound Name|Chemical Formula|Picture|Notes|
|:----|----------------|-------|------|
| Hydroxyl | Alcohol| $\ce{-OH}$ | [[https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/d0f2df15737d3feeaeea4cf4ec640413c493a875.png]] | This group is polar due to electronegative oxygen, which also allows for hydrogen bonds with water. Thus, it can help dissolve compounds like sugars. Typically, compounds with a hydroxyl group are alcohols. |
|Carbonyl| Ketone or Aldehyde| $\ce{C=O}$ | [[https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/c599e439d6d70c9056d48931515740f81119c1a2.png]] | A ketone is a carbonyl on a central atom. An aldehyde is a carbonyl on a terminal atom. Sugars with ketones are ketoses, sugars with aldehydes are aldoses. |
|Carboxyl| Carboxylic acid | $\ce{-COOH}$ | [[https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/72abebf791f804371ea5a4166d761bf006db41f4.png]] | Acidic, able to donate $\ce{H+}$. |
|Amino Group|Amine| $\ce{-NH2}$ | [[https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/7b8a1048ca747ec7c58340d0b35c50df02667093.png]] | Acts as a base |
