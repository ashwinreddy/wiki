All organic compounds contain hydrogen and carbon.

# Stanley Miller's Experiment

Stanley Miller created a closed system that roughly mimicked what we believed the conditions of early Earth were like.

1. A heated flask of water
2. Atmosophere of $\ce{H2}$, $\ce{CH4}$, $\ce{NH3}$ gas
3. Sparks discharged to mimic lightning

A sample for chemical analysis showed compounds like formaldehyde, hydrogen cyanide, as well as amino acids and hydrocarbons.

# Alkane

$\let\sb_$

the general formula is $\mathrm{C}\sb{n} \mathrm{H}_{2n+2}$
