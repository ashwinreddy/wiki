**Chemistry** is the study of matter. Sub-branches of chemistry include:

[Organic chemistry](./Organic Chemistry/) deals with compounds made of carbon, the building block of life.





Elements in the same column of the periodic table have the same number of electrons in their valence shell when neutral.

In a chemical equilibrium, forward and reverse reactions continue with no net effect on the concentrations of the reactants and products.

Atoms are most stable when all of the electron orbitals in the valence shell are filled.

A cation has positive charge, an anion has negative charge.
