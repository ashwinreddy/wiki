London Dispersion Forces are typically very weak forces between molecules caused by momentary or instantaneous dipoles, present even between nonpolar molecules, which would not ordinarily have dipoles.

Dipole-dipole forces are interactions between dipoles of molecules. Hydrogen bonding is a special example because it is so strong.

# Hydrogen Bonding

Between a hydrogen and a nitrogen, oxygen, or fluorine. The electronegativity difference makes this kind of IMF very strong.
