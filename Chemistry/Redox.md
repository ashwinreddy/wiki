A **redox reaction** is a reaction in which one reactant oxidizes (loses electrons) and another one reduces (gains electrons). The mnemonic OIL (oxidation is loss of electrons) RIG (reduction is gain of electrons) is helpful. The thing that is reduced is called the oxidizing agent; the thing that is oxidized is called a reducing agent. So for example, oxygen is an oxidizing agent.

In biological systems, adding oxygen oxidizes; partial pull from electronegativity considered oxidation. Adding a hydrogen is reducing.
