**Polarity** can refer to a bond or a molecule.

# Polar Bond

A polar bond is one for which the shared electrons are not shared equally. For this to happen, the elements in question must have an electronegativity difference greater than 0.5, so bonds between the same element are never polar. However, hydrogen-carbon bonds are nonpolar because their difference is less than 0.5.

# Polar Molecule

A polar molecule is one that has a net dipole. In other words, the shape of the molecule needs to be such that the dipole moments of the individual polar bonds do not cancel.
