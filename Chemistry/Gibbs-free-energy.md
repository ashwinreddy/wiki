Gibbs free energy is the portion of a system's energy that can perform work when temperature and pressure are uniform throughout a system, as in a living cell.

\begin{equation}
\Delta G = \Delta H - T \Delta S
\end{equation}

|Value of $\Delta G$|Interpretation|
|-------------------|---------------|
|$\Delta G < 0$|forward rxn spontaneous (exergonic rxn)|
|$\Delta G = 0$| equiibrium|
|$\Delta G > 0$|backward rxn spontaneous, forward rxn never spontaneous (endergonic rxn, puts free energy into molecules)|

Free energy is a measure of a system's instability -- therefore, its tendency to change to a more stable state.
