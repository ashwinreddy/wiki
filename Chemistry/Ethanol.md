**Ethanol** also known as ethyl alcohol or simply alcohol is $\ce{C2H6O}$. The term alcohol has two claimed etymologies:

- Arabic al-kuhul meaning "fine powdered antimony" for eye liner or "fine essence" / "essential quality" / "spirit"
- Alternatively, al-ghul meaning ghoul, demon, or fiendish spirit



Alcohol is produced by [fermenting glucose](../Biology/Ethanol-fermentation).

# Effects

## Neurochemistry

Alcohol increases inhibition by facilitating [[GABA]] action at GABA receptors. It is also a [[glutamate]] receptor antagonist.

## Health

Less than 1-2 drinks per day can increase HDL &amp; decrease LDL and atherosclerosis, perhaps decrease risk for heart attack.

Increases risk for female breast cancer, oral, and esophageal cancer.

## Acute

- Relaxation, anxiolytic, "disinhibition"
- Impairment of coordinated movement
- Impairment of memory storage (alcohol "blackout"), cognition
- Sleep (passing out, loss of consciousness)
- Death

## Chronic

- Abuse, addiction
- Fatty liver, hepatitis, cirrhosis
- Pancreatitis, diabetes, GI problems
- Peripheral neuropathy, cerebral atrophy, cognitive impairment


# Prevalence &amp; Cost
 
 For U.S. teenagers and older, 20% have never had alcohol, 66.3% have had it in the past year, and 52% have had it in the last month. At least 15% of current users (~20 million) have alcohol abuse problems.
 
Costs the US around 250 billion dollars each year. 

|Cost|Percent of events alcohol related|
|----|---------------------------------|
|Auto accident|50%|
|Fatal auto accident|33%|
|Violent crime|40%|
|Suicide|&gt;25%|

Around 100k die each year from alcohol.

Prevalence of alcohol abuse in general medical practice:

- outpatient: 15%
- inpatient: 40%
