**Diffusion** is the movement of particles spreading into available space. Substances diffuse down their **concentration gradient**. Diffusion (i.e. moving to regions of low density of the substance) requires no input of energy.


The diffusion of free water across a selectively permeable membrane, whether artificial or cellular, is called **osmosis**.
