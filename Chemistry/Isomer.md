An **isomer** of a molecule is one with the same molecular formula but either a different spatial arrangement or a different structure.

In [organic chemistry](../Biology/Organic Chemistry), a cis-trans isomer describes whether the functional groups are on the same side of the carbon chain or on opposite sides.
