**Gibbs' inequality** says that the [[Kullback-Leibler divergence]] is never negative and is zero only when its inputs are the same.

\begin{equation}
D_{KL}(P \parallel Q) \geqslant 0, \tag{Gibbs' inequality}
\end{equation}

with equality only if $P=Q$. We can prove it using [[Jensen's inequality]].
