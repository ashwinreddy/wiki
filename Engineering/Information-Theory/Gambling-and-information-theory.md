Gambling is a special case of investing in the stock market. We will look at the growth rate of investment in a horse race, which we will see is actually related to the entropy of the race.

# Horse Race Problem

There are $m$ horses in the race. The $i$th horse wins with probability $p_i$, and if that horse wins, its payoff is $o_i$ for 1.

The gambler distributes his wealth across all horses. A distribution $b$ describes how he bets. The fraction of the wealth invested in horse $i$ is $b_i$. We concluse that

\begin{equation}
\forall i, b_i \geq 0 \qquad \sum_{i=1}^m b_i = 1
\end{equation}
