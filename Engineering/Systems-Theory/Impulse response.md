The **impulse response** for some system with output $y(t)$ given input $x(t)$ refers to the output $h(t)$ when a delta impulse is fed in. [[Kronecker delta]] for discrete, [[Dirac delta function]] for continuous. When you have the impulse response, you can find the output for any given input by taking a convolution:

$$
y(t) = h(t) * x(t)
$$
