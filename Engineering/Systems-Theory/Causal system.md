A **causal system** depends on past and current inputs but not future inputs. This means the [[impulse response]] is right-handed signal, i.e. 

$$
\forall t < 0: h(t) = 0.
$$

$$
\forall n < 0 : h[n] = 0.
$$

# Conditions for LTI System

If a [[linear time-invariant system]] is causal, then the region of convergence of its [[transfer function]] $H(s)$ is a right-sided plane.
