**Sampling** is selecting values periodically from a continuous-time signal $x(t)$ at some fixed time interval $T$. Equivalently, we can talk about a sampling frequency $f_s = \frac{1}{T}$ and $\omega_s = \frac{2\pi}{T}$. 

These samples $\\{ x(nT) \\}$ for $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ make up a discrete-time signal $x_d[n]$.
