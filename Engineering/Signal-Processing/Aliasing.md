**Aliasing** is when a high frequency component in the frequency spectrum of signal takes the identity of a lower frequency component in the spectrum of the sampled signal. Roughly, it is spectral overlapping, i.e. when the frequency spectrum folds over with other frequency components due to replication as a result of sampling.

This happens if 

1. the signal doesn't have a find bandwidth
2. the sampling rate is too low.

The [[Nyquist theorem]] tells us how to avoid aliasing.
