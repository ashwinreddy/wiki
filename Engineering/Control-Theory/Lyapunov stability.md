Lyapunov stability. A system is stable if the state remains bounded for any initial condition and any bounded input sequence.

A discrete-time linear sytem

$$
\vec{x}[t+1] = A\vec{x}[t] + B\vec{u}[t]
$$

is stable if 

$$
\forall \lambda_i : \vert \lambda_i \vert < 1
$$


A continuous time system is stable if

$$
\forall \lambda_i : \Re \{\lambda_i\} < 0
$$
