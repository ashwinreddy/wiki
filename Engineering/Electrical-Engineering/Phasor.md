A phasor is a complex number representation of a wave of the form $A e^{j\phi}$ with $A$ the amplitude of the wave and $\phi$ the phase.

\begin{align}
x(t) &= A\cos(\omega t + \phi) \\\
&= \Re(Ae^{j(\omega t + \phi)}  ) \\\
&= \Re(Ae^{j\phi}e^{j\omega t})
\end{align}

Phasors are unique (there is a bijection between time waveforms with the same $\omega$ and phasors). They respect linearity
