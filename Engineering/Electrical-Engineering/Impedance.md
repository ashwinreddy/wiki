**Impedance** allows for the analysis of circuits with [[resistor]] and [[capacitor]] and [[inductor]] by giving each one a [[complex number]] that can be treated like its [[resistance]].

$$
Z_R = R
$$

$$
Z_L = \iota \omega L
$$

The inductor gives a 90 degree phase shift

$$
Z_C = \frac{1}{\iota \omega C}
$$

As $\omega$ increases, $|Z_C|$ decreases so that as $\omega \to 0$, $Z_c \to \infty$ and $\omega \to \infty$, $Z_C \to 0$.
