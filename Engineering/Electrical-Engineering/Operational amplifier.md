An **operational amplifier** or **op amp** can be used as a comparator or in negative feedback. It turns a small voltage difference into a big one.

# Golden rules

In our ideal model of an op amp, the following rules hold.

1.  \begin{equation}i_+ = i_- = 0 \tag{No current}\end{equation}

2. In negative feedback,  \begin{equation}u_+ = u_- \tag{Negative feedback}\end{equation}
