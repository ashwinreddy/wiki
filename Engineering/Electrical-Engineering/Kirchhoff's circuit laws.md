**Kirchhoff's circuit laws** refer to two laws for electric circuits.

Summing the signed [[electric current]] at every node results in zero.

\begin{equation}
\sum_{k =1}^n I_k = 0 \tag{KCL}
\end{equation}

The [[voltages|electric potential]] in a loop sum to nil.

\begin{equation}
\sum_{k=1}^n V_k = 0 \tag{KVL}
\end{equation}
