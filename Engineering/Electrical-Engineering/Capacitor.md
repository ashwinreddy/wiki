A **capacitor** stores [[electric charge]]. The physical configuration of capacitor determines its capacitance $C$, which tells us how much charge will accumulate for a given potential difference across the plates.

$$
C = q/V
$$


$$
i = C \dv{v}{t}
$$

$$
v(t) = \int_{t_0}^\infty i(t) \\, \dd{t}
$$
