A **capacitor** stores [[electric charge]]. The physical configuration of capacitor determines its capacitance $C$, which tells us how much charge will accumulate for a given potential difference across the plates.

\begin{equation}
C = q/v
\end{equation}

Therefore, the [[electric current]] $i$ obeys the equation

$$
i = C \dv{v}{t} \implies v(t) = \int_{t_0}^\infty i(t) \\, \dd{t}
$$
