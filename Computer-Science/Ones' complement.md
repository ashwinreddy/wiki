**Ones' complement** of a binary number is given by inverting all the digits. We can use this as a way of figuring out how to represent a negative number.

The positive numbers will have a leading zero. All the negative numbers will therefore have a leading one.

The binary odometer now increases normally as opposed to [[Sign-Magnitude]]. But we still have two zeros, so the final step is [[Two's complement]]
