In **fixed-point arithmetic** we have numbers like

$$
10.1010_2 = 1\times 2^1 + 1\times 2^{-1} + 1\times 2^{-3} = 2.625_{10}
$$

The point is "locked in" or decided beforehand, which is why we call it fixed point. If we want to do that, we do [[floa]]

The addition and subtraction are pretty much the same, but multiplication requires us to locate the point as in normal arithmetic.
