**Orders of growth** refers to how the time an algorithm takes is related to the size of its input.

|Notation|Name|Meaning|
|--------|----|--------|
|$\Theta(k)$|Constant|Time taken is independent of input size|
|$Î˜(n)$|Linear|Time taken adds by a constant amount when input is increased by 1|
|$\Theta(\log n)$|Logarithmic|Time taken adds by a constant amount when multiplied by a number|
