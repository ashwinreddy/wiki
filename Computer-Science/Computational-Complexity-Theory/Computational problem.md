A **computational problem** is a problem you can compute.

Hard
: A problem $X$ is **hard** for a [[complexity class]] of problems $C$ if every problem in $C$ can be [[reduced|reduction]] to $X$. 

Thus no problem in $C$ is harder than $X$, since an algorithm for $X$ allows us to solve any problem in $C$.

Complete
: A problem $X$ is complete for $C$ if it is in $C$ and hard for $C$
