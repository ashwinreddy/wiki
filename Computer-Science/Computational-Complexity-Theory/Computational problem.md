A **computational problem** is a problem you can compute.

Hard
: A hard problem $X$ for a [[complexity class]] $C$ is one to which every $C$-problem [[reduces|reduction]]. 

Thus no problem in $C$ is harder than $X$, since an algorithm for $X$ allows us to solve any problem in $C$.

Complete
: A complete problem $X$ for $C$ is one that is in $C$ and is hard for $C$.
