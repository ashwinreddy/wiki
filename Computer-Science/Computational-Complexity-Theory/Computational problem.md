A **computational problem** is a problem you can compute.

Hard
: A hard problem $X$ for a [[complexity class]] of problems $C$ is one to which every problem in $C$ [[reduces|reduction]]. 

Thus no problem in $C$ is harder than $X$, since an algorithm for $X$ allows us to solve any problem in $C$.

Complete
: A problem $X$ is complete for $C$ if it is in $C$ and hard for $C$
