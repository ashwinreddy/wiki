A **complexity class** is a [[set]] of [[computational problems|computational problem]].

# Hardness

A problem $X$ is **hard** for a class of problems $C$ if every problem in $C$ can be [[reduced|reduction]] to $X$. Thus no problem in $C$ is harder than $X$, since an algorithm for $X$ allows us to solve any problem in $C$.
