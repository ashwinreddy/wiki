An **NP-complete** problem is a [[computational problem]] whose solution can be used to quickly build up solutions to any other [[NP]] problem. 

$$
\textbf{NP-complete} = \textbf{NP} \cap \textbf{NP-hard}
$$

> All problems in NP (therefore any problem in [[P]] as well) reduce to an NP-complete problem.

To show a problem is NP-complete, you need to

1. Show you can verify it easily
2. Reduce an NP-complete problem to it.


# Examples

* [[3SAT]], independent set, vertex cover, Rudrata cycle
