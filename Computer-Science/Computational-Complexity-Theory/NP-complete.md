An **NP-complete** problem is one whose solution can be used to quickly build up solutions to any other [[NP]] problem. In other words, all problems in NP reduce to an NP-complete problem.

To show a problem is NP-complete, you need to

1. Show you can verify it easily
2. Reduce an NP-complete problem to it.


# Examples

* [[3SAT]], independent set, vertex cover, Rudrata cycle
