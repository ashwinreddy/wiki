**Computer science** is the science of computation, the means by which we give incontrovertible answers to unambiguous problems.

Problem
: A problem contains some inputs and a precise description of an output that one wants from those inputs

Algorithm
: A proposed solution to a problem in the form of a sequence of steps one must take. The steps should be such that anyone can follow them correctly.

Crucial to the practicable use of computer science is determining the language for describing an algorithm, especially since this language must be very clear. When such a language is chosen, the algorithm can be given to a "computer," which will produce the results exactly as specified. A computer used to refer to a person; today it refers to machines which can perform basic logic and arithmetic using electric circuits. Prior to the widespread use of electricity as the basis of compute, Charles Babbage and others worked on mechanical machines. Of course, for practical purposes one must be interested to a extent in the construction of computers, but as the quote goes,

> Computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes.

In general, a problem may be solved by a number of algorithms. The computer scientist is then interested in determining the properties of these algorithms. Every algorithm demands a payment of time and space, and it is desirable to use as little of these as possible.
