**Computer science** is the study of unambiguously describing and solving problems. When an unambiguous description is available, the process no longer requires a human to manually perform the steps.

As the quote goes,

> Computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes.

Computer science is enmeshed with mathematics, which provides the concepts for formalizing problems.
