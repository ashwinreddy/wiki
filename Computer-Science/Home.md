**Computer science** is the study of unambiguously describing and solving problems. A problem is specified by giving some inputs and describing precisely what kind of relevant output one wants from those inputs. Then, the problem is solved by specifying an algorithm, a sequence of steps to produce the desired output. 

The steps should be such that anyone can follow them correctly. When an unambiguous description is available, the process can be given to a "computer," which can produce the results exactly as specified. A computer used to refer to a person; today it refers to machines which can perform basic logic and arithmetic using electric circuits. 

In general, a problem may be solved by a number of algorithms. The computer scientist is then interested in determining the properties of these algorithms. Every algorithm demands a payment of time and space, and it is desirable to use as little of these as possible.



 Prior to the widespread use of electricity as the basis of compute, Charles Babbage and others worked on mechanical machines. Of course, for practical purposes one must be interested to a extent in the construction of computers, but as the quote goes,

> Computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes.

Computer science is clearly enmeshed with mathematics, which provides the concepts for formalizing problems.
