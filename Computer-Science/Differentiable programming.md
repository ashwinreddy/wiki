**Differentiable programming** is a programming paradigm where functions can be differentiated using [[automatic differentiation]]. Formally, we can model a program $P$ as a function on the [[vector space]] $\mathcal{V}$ of `float` variables, which we can call the program's **memory space**:

$$
P : \mathcal{V} \to \mathcal{V}
$$
