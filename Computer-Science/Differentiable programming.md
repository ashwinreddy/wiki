**Differentiable programming**

> We will model computer programs as maps on a [[vector space]]. If we only focus on the real valued variables (of type `float` or `double`), the state of the memory can be seen as a high dimensional vector. A set of all the possible states of the programâ€™s memory can be modeled by a finite dimensional real vector space $\mathcal{V} \equiv \RR^n$. We will call $\mathcal{V}$ the memory space of the program. The effect of a computer program on its memory space V, can be described by a map $P: \mathcal{V} \to \mathcal{V}$.
