**C** is a low-level programming language.

# Memory

* **Static storage** contains global variables
* **Stack** local variable storage
* **Heap** is where dynamic storage lives

# sizeof

Variables can be declared without values, holding garbage.

C gives you access to [[pointers|pointer]].

`sizeof` tells you the size of a type or variable in bytes.

# Pointers

A pointer to an int is a `int *p`. A generic pointer is a `void *p`.
