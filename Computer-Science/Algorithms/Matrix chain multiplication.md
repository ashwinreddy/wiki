**Matrix chain multiplication** is an [[optimization problem]] where we want to use the [[associative property]] of [[matrix multiplication]] to minimize the number of multiplications we have to do.

Suppose we want to compute $A_1 A_2 \dots A_n$ with dimensions $m_0 \times m_1, m_1 \times m_2, \dots, m_{n-1} \times m_n$.
