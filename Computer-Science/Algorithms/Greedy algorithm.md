A **greedy algorithm** is an [[algorithm]] that builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most obvious and immediate benefit.

For example, say that a doctor's office has $n$ patients where customer $i$ takes $t(i)$ minutes and we want to minimize average waiting time. Clearly, we should sort patients by time and take the largest $t(i)$ first. 


We can also use an exchange argument by proving that greedy stays ahead.
