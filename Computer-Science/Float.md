A **float** is a datatype representing a real number with a "floating point." We have to specify the "energy" (the significant figures) and the exponent which floats the point appropriately. It's [[scientific notation]].


$$
(-1)^S \times (1 + \mathsf{Significand}) \times 2^{\mathsf{Exponent} - 127}
$$
