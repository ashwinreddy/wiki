Integer overflow is when a number gets so big, it wraps back to 0 _OR_ if decreasing it wraps to the largest value.

Overflow errors occur when the correct result doesn't fit in the range of values that can be represented. This happens, for example, when the addends have the same sign and the result has the opposite sign.
