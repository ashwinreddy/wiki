**Monte Carlo tree search** is a [[tree]] search algorithm using Monte-Carlo evaluation introduced in @coulom2006efficient.

> Monte Carlo Tree Search has one main purpose: given a game state to choose the most promising next move. -- [Monte Carlo Tree Search – beginners guide](https://int8.io/monte-carlo-tree-search-beginners-guide)

It is [[Monte Carlo algorithm]] in the sense that it simulate the game many times and predict the most promising move based on the results.
