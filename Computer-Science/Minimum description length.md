**Minimum description length (MDL)**  is an information theoretic approach to inductive inference with roots in algorithmic coding theory. It has become one of the most popular means for [[model selection]] [@zhang2012model]. The key idea is that

> any regularities in a dataset can be exploited to compress it, and hence learning is reformulated as losslessly transmitting the data with the fewest number of bits.



The [[normalized maximum likelihood]] method is optimal (in what sense?) w.r.t. MDL.
