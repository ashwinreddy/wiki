**Minimum description length (MDL)** casts statistical inference/prediction in terms of information theory and optimal coding. Simply put,

> any regularities in a dataset can be exploited to compress it, and hence learning is reformulated as losslessly transmitting the data with the fewest number of bits.



The [[normalized maximum likelihood]] method is optimal (in what sense?) w.r.t. MDL.
