*Minimum description length (MDL)** casts statistical inference/prediction in terms of information theory and optimal coding. The idea is to forgo using a true probability distribution, and instead we focus on compressing a data set by looking for regularities. 

The [[normalized maximum likelihood]] method is optimal (in what sense?) w.r.t. MDL.
