**Artificial intelligence** is about trying to embed intelligence into computational systems. What defines or undergirds human intelligence is up to debate, but the goal of artificial intelligence is to find it from a bottom-up approach. Since human brains can do computations, we hypothesize that those computations can be replicated systematically.

For a purely logical game like chess, an artificial intelligence can achieve superhuman performance simply by being able to think more steps ahead.
