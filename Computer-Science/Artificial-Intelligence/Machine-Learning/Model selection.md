**Model selection** 

> refers to the task of selecting, among several competing alternatives, the “best” statistical model given experimental data. To avoid ambiguity, “best” here has a now-standard operational definition – the commonly accepted criterion is that models must not only show reasonable goodness-of-fit in accounting for existing data, but also demonstrate some kind of simplicity so that it would not capture sampling noise in the data. This criteria, emphasizing generalization as opposed to fitting as the goal of modeling, embodies Occam’s Razor, the principle of offering parsimonious explanation of data with fewest assumptions. Though mathematical implementations may differ, resulting in the various methods such as AIC, BIC, MDL, etc., each invariably boils down to balancing two aspects of model evaluation, one measuring its goodness-offit over existing data and the other measuring its complexity or capability for generalization.
