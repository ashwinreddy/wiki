**Meta-learning** is often described as "learning to learn," but simply refers to getting a computer to quickly adapt to a set of test tasks after being given the chance to learn on training tasks.

> Learning quickly is a hallmark of human intelligence,
whether it involves recognizing objects from a few examples or quickly learning new skills after just minutes of
experience. Our artificial agents should be able to do the same, learning and adapting quickly from only a few examples, and continuing to adapt as more data becomes available. [@maml]
