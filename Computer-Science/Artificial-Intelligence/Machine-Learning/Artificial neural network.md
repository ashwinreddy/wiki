An **artificial neural network (ANN)** or simply **neural network** is a model vaguely representing neurons in the brain. A neural network with one hidden layer (of enough units) is a universal function approximator!

# Neuron

The mathematical abstraction of the neuron is a unit that computes

$$
y_i  = g\left(\sum_j w_{ij} x_j\right)
$$

where $g$ is an [[activation function]].
