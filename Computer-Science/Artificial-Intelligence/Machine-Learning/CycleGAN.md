**[CycleGAN](https://junyanz.github.io/CycleGAN/)** is an algorithm that performs image-to-image translation, that is learns mappings $G: X \to Y$ as well as $F: Y \to X$ from domain $X$ to $Y$ _without explicit pairings_. For example, $X$ could be any set of horse pictures and $Y$ could be any set of zebra pictures.
