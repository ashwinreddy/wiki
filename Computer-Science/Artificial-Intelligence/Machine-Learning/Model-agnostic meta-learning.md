**Model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML)** is an algorithm for [[meta-learning]] [@finn2017modelagnostic]. The idea is to train the model's parameters in such a way that doing a couple gradient steps with new data leads to good performance.

> The process of training a modelâ€™s parameters such that a
few gradient steps, or even a single gradient step, can produce good results on a new task can be viewed from a feature learning standpoint as building an internal representation that is broadly suitable for many tasks.
