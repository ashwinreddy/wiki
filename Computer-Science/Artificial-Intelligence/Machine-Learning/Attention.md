**Attention**. Think about a key-value-query system. We generate a query $q_t$ at every timestep, which comes from some query function $q(\cdot)$. We also have keys $k$ and values $v$.

We compare the query to each key. That gives us scores for each key. We can [[softmax]] to get a [[probability distribution]].
