**Offline reinforcement learning** is a kind of data-driven RL using only a static dataset of experience without being able to try anything online.

>  Offline RL algorithms promise to learn effective policies from previously-collected, static datasets without further interaction. However, in practice, offline RL presents a major challenge, and standard off-policy RL methods can fail due to overestimation of values induced by the distributional shift between the dataset and the learned policy.
