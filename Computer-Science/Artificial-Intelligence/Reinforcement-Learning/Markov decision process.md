A **Markov decision process** is a way of modeling an environment.

* Set of states $\mathcal{S}$
* Set of actions $\mathcal{A}$
* Transition probability $T(s' \mid s, a)$ or $\mathcal{P}^a_{ss'}$
* [[Reward function]] $r$

Other elements that show up are

* [[Discount factor]] $\gamma$
* Initial state distribution $d_0$
