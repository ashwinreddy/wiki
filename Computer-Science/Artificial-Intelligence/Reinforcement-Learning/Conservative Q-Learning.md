**Conservative Q-Learning** [@kumar2020conservative] is an [[offline reinforcement learning]] algorithm that modifies [[Q-learning]] so not to be erroneously high on states it has not seen before. The algorithm comes up with a lower bound on the Q value, thereby making it conservative.


It says the Q-functions for OOD actions are pushed down.
