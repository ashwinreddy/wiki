**BayCRL** is an algorithm that tries to do RL using only _successful outcome examples_: states in which the desired task has been accomplished successfully. It builds on [[VICE|Variational Inverse Control with Events]] to do goal-oriented exploration, but it needs a way to handle uncertainty. We need an uncertainty-aware classifier for successful states.
