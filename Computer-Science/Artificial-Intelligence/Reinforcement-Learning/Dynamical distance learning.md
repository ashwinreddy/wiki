**Dyanmical distance learning (DDL)** is an method for learning a dynamics-aware embedding of a [[metric]] that can be used as a [[reward function]] for goal-reaching. There are two steps:

1. _Distance evaluation_: learn a policy-specific dynamical distance
2. _Policy improvement_: optimize policy to reach goal using distance function as negative reward.
