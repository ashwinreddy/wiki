**Variational Inverse Control with Events (VICE)** is an [[algorithm]], introduced in @fu2018variational that builds on inverse reinforcement learning to more limited forms of expert supervision, for example just showing desired goal states. It does so using the [[control as inference]] perspective.


1. Classifier training learns parameters to the PGM.
2. Inferring the optimal actions results in policy optimization.
