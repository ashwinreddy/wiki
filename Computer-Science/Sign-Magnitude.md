**Sign-Magnitude** is a representation for binary numbers where we reserve the leftmost bit to be a 0 to mean positive and set it to a 1 to mean negative. There's no free lunch, so we give up the ability to represent 2x as many things.

Here's the problem:

* We have two zeros
* The positive increase in one direction, the negatives increase in the other.

So it's pretty much just used in some signal processing contexts. The next approach is [[Ones' complement]]
