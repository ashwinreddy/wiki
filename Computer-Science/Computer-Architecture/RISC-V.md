**RISC-V** is a simplified [[instruction set architecture]] for computers.

RISC-V has 32 integer registers.

# Data transfer

The world is processor centric, so we _load from_ and _store to_ memory. Thus, the first argument is register and the second is a point in memory.

# Instructions

|Type|Op|
|---|-|
|R|Register-register|
|I|Short immediate data and load|
|S|Fetch store|
|B|Conditional jump|
|U|Long immediate|
|J|Unconditional jump|
