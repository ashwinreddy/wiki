The **two's complement** of a binary number is one plus its [[ones' complement]]. 

$$
\mathsf{Two's Complement}(n) = 1 + ~n
$$

It offers a convenient way of representing a number's negative.

# Representing negative numbers

The first bit is reserved for the sign. 0 is positive, 1 is negative. 

When you want a number's negative, you take its two's complement.
