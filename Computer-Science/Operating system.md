The **operating system** serves 3 roles:

1. Referee - makes sure no one program hogs too many resources, schedules threads / processes
2. Glue - provides common services like access to a file system or network connections
3. Illusionist - provide easy-to-use abstractions (e.g. virtual memory, system calls)
