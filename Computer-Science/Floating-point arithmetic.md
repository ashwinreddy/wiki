**Floating-point arithmetic** is the arithmetic that follows when storing numbers in essentially the same way that people write down numbers in scientific notation. Recall that scientific notation represents a number $x$ in the form

\begin{equation}
x = m \times 10^n
\end{equation}

where $m$ is called the significand or mantissa and $n$.
