**Floating-point arithmetic** is the arithmetic that follows when storing [[real number]] in essentially the same way that people write down numbers in [[scientific notation]]. 

* It is not add associative.


A floating-point number is defined in IEEE 754 standard. [This article](https://fabiensanglard.net/floating_point_visually_explained/index.html) provides a good explanation.
