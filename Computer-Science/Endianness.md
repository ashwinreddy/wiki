**Endianness**. Big-endian means the most significant byte is at the smallest memory address and least significant byte at the largest. Little-endian means the most significant byte is at the largest memory address and the least significant byte is at the smallest.


|Type|Smaller memory address|Larger memory address|
|----|----------------------|---------------------|
|Big-endian|MSB|LSB|
|Little-endian|LSB|MSB|
