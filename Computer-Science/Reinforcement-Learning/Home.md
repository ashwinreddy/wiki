# Reinforcement Learning Algorithms

- First question to ask is: does the agent have access to an environment model? Algorithms that do are **model-based**, algorithms that don't are **model-free**.
- What does the algorithm learn?
  - policy
  - action-value function
  - value function
  - environment model
