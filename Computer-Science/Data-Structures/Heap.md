A **heap** is a [[tree]] with the heap property. For a max-heap, the property is that the labels of both children are less than the node's label. For a min-heap, the childrens' labels are greater than than the parent's.

Heaps can be made nearly complete, i.e. every row (except possibly the last) has the max number of children.
