> in the making of speech and language the spirit is continually "sparking" between matter and mind, as it were, playing with this wondrous nominative faculty. behind every abstract expression there lie the boldest of metaphors, and every metaphor is a play upon words. thus in giving expression to life man creates a second, poetic world alongside the world of nature. -- Johan Huizinga

metaphor is a [[literary device]] which imbues one thing, the tenor, with a sense of another, the vehicle. for example, in "all the world's a stage," the world is the tenor and stage is the vehicle. 

metaphors have been discussed by [[aristotle]] and [[borges]]. in [metaphors we live by](https://www.worldcat.org/title/metaphors-we-live-by/oclc/1050036394&referer=brief_results), [[george lakoff]] and mark johnson argue that far from being just a literary device, metaphor is core to how [[language]] operates. (i believe [[steven pinker]] has a similar thesis).

lakoff & johnson use metaphors to drive a wedge between the binary that either there is absolute truth or people have just their personal truth. in fact, they say, metaphors seem to capture aspects of both. [good summary here](http://www.yorku.ca/hjackman/Teaching/Toledo/3060/lakoff5.html). 

other observations about metaphors are
* A metaphor has to have the right distance between the tenor and vehicle. If the objects are too close, the metaphor doesn't bring out any insight. If they are too far away, it feels contrived.
* A metaphor is usually not reversible. You can say "life is a highway," but "a highway is life" sounds strange.


## examples

a nice list of [metaphors in man pages](https://jvns.ca/blog/2020/05/08/metaphors-in-man-pages/) here. I've recorded most of the examples Lakoff and Johnson use below:
