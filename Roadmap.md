Here are some of the topics I'd like to develop further:

* A general framework for thinking about biology (e.g. Schrodinger's What is Life, The Machinery of Life by David S Goodsell, biology from a CS perspective)
* Philosophies, in particular pragmatism, stoicism, epicureanism, absurdism, etc. May also include Eastern philosophy like Hinduism (Bhagavad Gita) and Buddhism
* A high level understanding of analytic mechanics (Hamilton's equations, Legendre transform from Lagrangian to Hamiltonian, Poisson bracket)
* Working understanding of basic concepts in thermodynamics (perhaps a starting resource would be Chapter 1 from Gould and Tobochnik?)
* Godel's theorems
* How does Artificial intelligence handle causal reasoning?
* A general history/chronology for modern physics
* What do socialism, neoliberalism, etc. actually mean?
* What were Marx's criticisms of capitalism?
* Develop general understanding of AI (e.g. DeepMind's AtHomeWithAI Curated Resource List)
* How do differential forms work?
* What are some of the cool applications of information theory?
* What is the philosophy of science?
* What are the basic ideas of music theory? Can I approach it from a mathematical background?
* How can we explain calculus simply (Calculus Made Easy by Silvanus Thompson)

Miscellaneous

* Natural wonders every child should know?
