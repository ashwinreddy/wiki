Here are some of the topics I'd like to develop further:

* A general framework for thinking about biology (e.g. Schrodinger's What is Life, The Machinery of Life by David S Goodsell, biology from a CS perspective)
* Numerical linear algebra [[https://github.com/fastai/numerical-linear-algebra/]]
* Probability, e.g. [[http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2018/09/13/waiting-time-paradox/]]
* Philosophies, in particular pragmatism, stoicism, epicureanism, absurdism, etc. May also include Eastern philosophy like Hinduism (Bhagavad Gita) and Buddhism
* A high level understanding of analytic mechanics (Hamilton's equations, Legendre transform from Lagrangian to Hamiltonian, Poisson bracket)
* Working understanding of basic concepts in thermodynamics (perhaps a starting resource would be Chapter 1 from Gould and Tobochnik?)
* Godel's theorems
* How does Artificial intelligence handle causal reasoning?
* A general history/chronology for modern physics
* What do socialism, neoliberalism, etc. actually mean?
* What were Marx's criticisms of capitalism?
* Develop general understanding of AI (e.g. DeepMind's AtHomeWithAI Curated Resource List)
* How do differential forms work?
* What are some of the cool applications of information theory?
* What is the philosophy of science?
* What are the basic ideas of music theory? Can I approach it from a mathematical background?
* Computational music synthesis by Sean Luke, George Mason Uni
* What structures do we actually need for the cool generalizations in Riemannian geometry?
* Is it worth exploring the mathematics of robotic manipulation (Murray, Li, Sastry) ? 
* What are tensors?
* What is semiotics?
* What is differential geometry?
* What do Noether's theorems say?
* What are the basic ideas in economics?
* What is Lie theory? What can you do with it?
* Can you understand optimal transport without heavy math?
* How do quaternions work?
* What is the math of special relativity?
* What is Bayesian data analysis/statistics?
* How do we get to generalized Stoke's theorem?
* What is geometric algebra? [[https://crypto.stanford.edu/~blynn/haskell/ga.html]]
* What is general relativity?
* [[https://arxiv.org/abs/1001.1778]]
