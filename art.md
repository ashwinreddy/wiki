> all art is quite useless. -- [[wilde]]

the greeks spoke of art as mimesis, mimicking nature. The German idealists ([[kant]] and [[friedrich schiller]]) saw art as a form of [[play]]. 

> art is a [[human]] activity, consisting in this, that one man consciously, by means of certain external [[sign]]s, hands on to others feelings he has lived through, and that other people are infected by these feelings, and also [[experience]] them. -- [[tolstoy]]

[[what is philosophy?]] says art is a response to [[chaos]]. for [[deleuze]], art produces sensations, affects, and intensities, but it also deals with [[problem]]s.
