a [stance](https://meaningness.com/stances-nature-toc) is a pattern people use to think about [[meaningness]]. We care about stances because people are rarely strict followers of a system, philosophical or otherwise. The extremes are Eternalism, which says everything has meaning, and [[nihilism]], which says nothing has meaning.

[[nihilism]] says that nothing has meaning. eternalism says everything is loaded with meaning. both are wrong. is there some middle ground we can hit? there are confused stances in the middle, but meaningness tries to accept the ambiguity of meaning for what it is. 

we can compare the two stances in a [table](https://meaningness.com/all-dimensions-schematic-overview) or look at the series of stances that appear in an [example](https://meaningness.com/stances-are-unstable).
