new criticism is a school of literature that began with John Crowe Ransom's _the new criticism_ (1941). The basic tenets are

- The text is a formal, aesthetic object that stands on its own.
- The right way to analyze a text is by close reading.
- The close reading is a careful interpretation of the words used in a passage.
- The author's intentions do not matter.
- The reader's personal reaction does not matter.

It attempts to be like a formal science, but I think the focus on [[interpretation]] makes it a variant of [[lectio divina]].
