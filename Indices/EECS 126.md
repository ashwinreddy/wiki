**EECS 126 - Probability and Random Processes** give us tools to quantify and model uncertainty and randomness (since life is uncertain), which appear in many applications like

* Decision making under uncertainty
* Communication systems
* Network modeling / resource provisioning
* Tracking / filtering
* Faster performance in algorithms
* AI / ML

Mathematicians ask, given a model, what can you say about the experiments. Statisticians ask, given outcomes of an experiment, what is a good model. Engineers / scientists choose a model to capture a problem we're faced with and analyze it.
