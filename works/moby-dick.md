_moby-dick_ is a [[novel]] written by herman [[melville]] following ishmael, who, along with harpooner queequeg, decides to join the _pequod_ on a whaling expedition. but the ship is led by captain ahab, whose only goal is to find and kill moby-dick, the whale that bit him years ago.

To my mind, the novel is significant not only for combining the forms of [[epic poem]] and [[essay]] but also for its deep symbolism and spiritual disposition.

moby-dick is greatly inspired by [[paradise lost]] and the language of [[shakespeare]] and the [[bible]].
