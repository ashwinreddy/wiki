_a treatise of human nature_ is a book by [[hume]]. 

1. What science can discover depends on what humans can know.
2. We need to observe how humans come to knowledge carefully.
3. That happens through experience.

He starts by saying that the mind perceives two kinds of things: ideas and impressions. Impressions are "sensations, passions, and emotions." Ideas are "faint images of these in thinking and reasoning." The division is not always so clear, but he thinks them generally distinct enough to be useful. Next, there is another axis, which is simple versus complex. 

At first blush, it seems like ideas and impressions come together, with some kind of correlation or parallelism between them. But Hume points out that complex ideas don't come from impressions. So _simple_ ideas and impressions come together and the difference is only one of degree of force, but the same cannot be said of complex ones, though there is often a resemblance. Our simple ideas come from simple impressions and exactly represent them.
