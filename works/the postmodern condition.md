_la condition postmoderne: rapport sur le savoir_ is a [[book]] by [[lyotard]] about [[postmodern]]ism. 

## introduction

- [[philosophy]] is the discourse which legitimates science.
- _modern_ means a science that appeals to an explicit grand narrative ([[dialectic]] of [[geist]], hermeneutics of meaning, emancipation of rational or working subject, creation of wealth)
	- e.g. [[enlightenment]]: if rational minds agree on a statement, it is true and the statement helps foster universal peace.
- _[[postmodern]]_ means incredulity toward grand narratives.

> the narrative function is losing its functors, its great hero, its great dangers, its great voyages, its great goal. it is being dispersed in clouds of narrative language elements -- narrativ, but also denotative, prescriptive, descriptive, and so on. conveyed within each cloud are pragmatic valences specific to its kind. each of us lives at the intersection of many of these. however, we do not necessarily establish stable language combinations, and the properties of the ones we do establish are not necessarily communicable.

> thus the society of the future falls less within the province of a newtonian anthropology (such as [[structuralism]] or systems theory) than a [[pragmatics]] of language particles. there are many different language games -- a heterogeneity of elements. they only give rise to institutions in patches -- local determinism.

> in matters of social justice and of scientific truth alike, the legitimation of that power is based on optimizing the system's performance -- efficiency. the application of this criterion to all of our games necessarily entails a certain level of terror, whether soft or hard: be operational (that is, commensurable) or disappear.


## knowledge in computerized societies

knowledge changes when societies become postindustrial, cultures postmodern. lyotard takes as his focus technical subjects ([[linguist]]ics, [[cybernetics]], algebra, information). two functions to note:

1. research
2. transmission of acquired learning

we think of information as fungible in some sense.

> the old principle that the acquisition of knowledge is indissociable from the training (_bildung_) of minds, or even of individuals, is becoming obsolete and will become ever more so.
