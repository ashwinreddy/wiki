_die frage nach der technik_ is an essay in [[phenomenology]] by [[heidegger]] about [[technology]]. 

heidegger starts by saying that the essence of technology is not something technological.  The usual definition of technology is one of instrumentation (a human activity as well as a means to an end). Since we're talking about means and ends, causality is already in play. In technology, we think of efficient causes and not final causes (or material or formal causes). But remember, Aristotle's causes aren't really causes but explanations.

|Cause|Responsibility|
|------|---------------|
| Material | Matter (_Hyle_) |
| Form | Aspect (_Eidos_) |
| Final | _Telos_ |
| Efficient | _Logos_ (?) |

These are modes of occasioning, in bringing-forth. Every bringing-forth is grounded in revealing. 

Technology is a way of revealing, namely the setting-upon that challenges. Things are ordered into standing-reserve (_Bestand_). 

_Example_. An airliner on a runway is an object. If we reveal it, it is standing-reserve for transportation. 

It is man who accomplishes the challenging setting-upon through which what we call the actual is revealed as standing-reserve. 

Enframing (_Gestell_) is the challenging claim that gathers man with a view to ordering the self-revealing as standing-reserve. The essence of modern technology is in enframing.
