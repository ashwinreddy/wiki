> i want to live happily in a world i don't understand. -- Taleb

_antifragile_ is a book and [[concept]] by Nassim Taleb, about how systems deal with [[chaos]] and Black Swans. Broadly, there are three categories of systems on a spectrum.

|Type|Figure|Meaning|
|-------|-----|--------|
|Fragile|Damocles|Crumbles under perturbation|
|Robust|Phoenix|Persists under perturbation|
|Antifragile|Hydra|Strengthens under perturbation|

Taleb coins the word _antifragile_, but since he considers time as an example of chaos, there is an existing synonym for antifragile: futureproof. 

## antifragile techniques

Antifragile systems need some stressors to thrive.
