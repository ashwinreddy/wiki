the _aeneid_ is a [[epic poem]] written by [[virgil]] in [[latin]] telling the founding [[myth]] of rome by the trojan prince aeneas. when the ploy of the trojan horse succeeds and the greeks set fire to the city, aeneas flees with his father anchises and son ascanius, also known as iulus. in the first half of the poem, aeneas and his crew find their way to italy, similar to the _[[odyssey]]_. In the second half, he prepares for war with the latins, similar to the _[[iliad]]_. If the _iliad_ is about the wrath of achilles and the _odyssey_ the cunning of odysseus, the _aeneid_ is about the piety of aeneas.
