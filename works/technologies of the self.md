[technologies of the self](https://www.worldcat.org/title/technologies-of-the-self-a-seminar-with-michel-foucault/oclc/988085468&referer=brief_results) was a 1928 seminar by [[michel foucault]] tracing the "development of the hermeneutics of the self" as a [[technology]] in [[platonism]], [[hellenistic philosophy]], and western christian monasticism. Foucault had published _[the history of sexuality](https://www.worldcat.org/title/history-of-sexuality-an-introduction/oclc/1156091497&referer=brief_results)_ in 1976, and he talks about how this led him to become interested in technologies of the self.

> i conceived of a rather odd project: not the evolution of sexual behavior but the projection of a history of the link between the obligation to tell the truth and the prohibitions against sexuality. i asked: how had the subject been compelled to decipher himself in regard to what was forbidden? it is a question of the relation between asceticism and truth. 

there are 4 major types of technologies.

|Type|Ability|
|----|-------|
|Production|Produce, transform, manipulate things|
|Sign systems ([[semiotics]])|Use signs, meanings, symbols, or signification|
|Power|Turn other individuals into objects for some end|
|Self|Let individuals effect their own means or transform themselves|

He starts with _epimelesthai sauton_ (take care of yourself) and _gnothi sauton_ (know yourself in _[[alcibiades]]_ and _[[apology]]_. It appears also in Christian asceticism and [[epicureanism]]. But the latter has overtaken the latter because knowledge of the self took priority in philosophy (Foucault points to theory from [[descartes]] to Husserl) and religion.

These communities placed a great focus on [[reading]] and [[Writing]] as a technique for knowing the self.
