Bill decides to leave before anything happens. He goes to a jazz club to see Nick Nightingale, an old friend from medical school who has dropped out and become a pianist. Nick tells Bill he's playing at a secret event and gives him the password. Bill goes to a costume shop to get a dress. Strangely, the owner of the costume shop catches his daughter with two men and threatens to call the police. Finally, he goes to the event, but it turns out to be a ritual, and the members catch on that Bill shouldn't be there. A masked woman warns him to leave, but when she is caught, she chooses to sacrifice herself.
