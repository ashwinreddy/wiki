_ethica_ is [[spinoza]]'s _magnum opus_. 


[[deleuze]] is careful to distinguish Spinoza's terms _affectus_ (which he calls "affect") and _affectio_ (which he calls "affection"). Spinoza's idea is a representational mode of thought (e.g. a triangle). On the other hand, an affect is a mode of thought which doesn't represent anything (e.g. hope, pain, love). In the 17th century, Deleuze says, people took the idea to have primacy over the affect. Because to will something, or hope for something, love for something, etc., one has to have an idea, even a confused idea, about the object of their affect.
