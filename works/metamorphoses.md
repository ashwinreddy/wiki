> _omnia mutantur, nihil interit_ (15.165)

_metamorphoses_ (Greek/Latin for transformations) is a lengthy narrative poem (is it an [[epic poem]]?) written in Latin by the Roman poet [[ovid]]. It covers greek [[myth]], beginning with a creation myth. The thematic connection is change and [[chaos]]. In the poem, the gods are just as fickle and shifty as humans.

I like Charles Martin's [translation](https://www.worldcat.org/title/metamorphoses/oclc/52547579) and the Latin text at [Perseus](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0029%3Abook%3D1%3Acard%3D1).
