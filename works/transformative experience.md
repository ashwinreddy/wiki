_transformative experience_ is a book and [[concept]] developed by philosopher l.a. paul. It asks the question, when you are presented with the opportunity to transform into _x_, where _x_ is a state of being with a completely different experience than your current state, what do you do?

First, some terms. An experience is **epistemically transformative** if you can only know what it's like if you try it (e.g. trying a new fruit, seeing a new color). It is **personally transformative** if it changes your point of view (e.g. taking a course, reading powerful fiction). We're thinking here about experiences that are both.

It is difficult to make a rational choice in this case because (a) you lack information, (b) your preferences would change afterward and (c) you're effectively reasoning about a different self. In other words, (a) what are the utilities, (b) which are the utilities, (c) which outcomes are relevant?

Empirically, it seems like [changing](https://www.sivv.io/article/5ecededf46cc9f76d4639b24/In-marginal-decisions,-favour-action-over-inaction) into the new state tends to make people more satisfied. 


Here are some [notes](https://lapaul.org/papers/teaching-guide-for-transformative-experience.pdf) on transformative experience.
