_anti-oedipus_ is the first volume of [[capitalism and schizophrenia]]. It's about [[Psychoanalysis]] of [[desire]], [[capitalism]], [[fascism]], and [[interpretation]]. D&G see the idea of Oedipus and the idea of desire as lack from Freudian psychoanalysis as incorrect. Desire is not defined by lack, but rather it is a process of experimentation on a plane of immanence. It can form connections enhance the power of bodies. They are trying to de-individualize and de-sexualize desire.
