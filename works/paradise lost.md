_paradise lost_ is an [[epic poem]] in english by [[john milton]]. suffused in allusions to [[bible]] and [[christianity]]'s [[myth]] and thinking, the poem covers in 12 books,[^number-books] the story of satan's fall from grace, his attempt at revenge by assuming the form of a serpent, and the temptation of adam and eve. _paradise lost_ is milton's attempt to create a great epic poem in the english language and to "justify the ways of God to men". the poem is notable for its use of blank verse rather than rhyme. 

[^number-books]: it was originally 10 books. the choice of 12 books recalls the [[aeneid]].
