_Le pli: Leibnitz et le Baroque_ is a book by [[deleuze]] on [[leibniz]] and Baroque architecture, which he says functions by endlessly producing, twisting, turning folds on itself to infinity in two places:

- Pleats of matter
- Folds in the soul

There is a correspondence between the two labyrinths.

> A multiplicity is not what has many parts. It is what is "complicated," or folded many times over and in many ways such that there is no completely unfolded state, but only further bifurcations, as in [[borges]]' fable of the garden of ever-forking paths. -- [[deleuze connections]]
