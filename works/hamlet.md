_the tragedy of hamlet, prince of denmark_ is an english [[tragedy]] by [[shakespeare]]. one of his longest and most complex plays, it has been an enduring staple of english [[literature]] and [[literary criticism]]. the critic harold bloom calls the play "poem unlimited," a phrase of polonius.

_hamlet_ is a story about a troubled family. the father, king hamlet, has mysteriously died, leaving uncle claudius to take the throne and marry the mother gertrude. The son, prince hamlet, has a clear call to action here. but what makes Hamlet interesting and frustrating is his inability to act: his intellect, his seeming awareness that he is in a play, his self-reflexivity all get in the way. he may be the first modern individual.

to avoid detection by claudius, hamlet also pretends to be mad. it is a perennial question whether hamlet is indeed mad or only putting on an act. In _[[gesta danorum]]_, which contains the basic story of amleth (his original name), hamlet's madness is only an act. incidentally, _[the northman](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11138512/)_ is a sibling work to _hamlet_ because it derives from that book.

there's influence of the [[stoic]]s and a good dose of [[existentialism]] in it as well as connections to the Protestant Reformation in it (see [[technologies of the self]]).
