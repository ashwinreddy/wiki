_nietzsche et la philosophie_ is a book by [[deleuze]] about [[nietzsche]].  

## the tragic

for nietzsche, the project of [[critique]] is discovering whence values come. evaluation is the concomitant way of being or existing, thus your values come from your style of life (reverse of what people usually think). nietzsche therefore fights back against two kinds of people

1. people like [[kant]] and [[schopenhauer]] who criticize things with their catalogued values (the indifference of values because they come from a high foundation)
2. utilitarians or scholars who derive values from "objective facts" (the indifference of values because of simple derivation)

a philosopher is one who does [[genealogy]], like [[hesiod]], not a kantian tribunal judge or a utilitarian mechanic. nietzsche says, there is a differential element to values they are not recognizing.

critique is not reaction, revenge, grudge, or _ressentiment_

> but the active expression of an active mode of existence; attack and not revenge, the natural aggression of a way of being, the divine wickedness without which perfection could not be imagined (_ecce homo_ i 6-7).

philosophy for him is also a symptomatology and semeiology. there are not appearances and essences nor causes and effects. there are senses and phenomena. so we've got to figure out what forces are driving things, driving history, which is the variation of senses. 

the philosopher's art is interpreting, weighing. 

> a thing has as many senses as there are forces capable of taking possession of it. but the thing itslf is not neutral and will have more or less affinity with the force in current possession. 

new forces have to pretend to be old forces first. so the philosopher's genealogy is with the priest. it's a ridiculous image, the philosopher-sage, but it returns to ascesis while it looks for its anti-religious force. 

> genealogy does not appear on the first night and that we risk serious misunderstanding if we look for the child's father at the birth. the difference in the origin does not appear at the origin. 


deleuze and nietzsche agree that philosophy is greek from the ground up. the philosopher is a friend of wisdom who appeals to a mask for ends hardly wise at all, for wisdom to overcome itself and be overcome.
