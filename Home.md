The general philosophy of this wiki is to contain detailed notes on subjects of intellectual inquiry (as opposed to opinions or personal ponderings). In a sense, it will be somewhat like Wikipedia, but with writing that makes sense because they come from me. Keep the following in mind:

1. Add and write an article iff you have enough to say something substantial. You should be able to give at least a 5 minute talk on the topic. There's no value added with simple definitions. On the other hand, feel free to explore with documents, scratch paper, or other formats!
2. Verify that only ideas you feel confident are true are in here. It's okay to be wrong else where, but give yourself at least one place where you can trust your knowledge.
3. On the other hand, don't feel pressure to generalize ideas further than you understand them. It's okay to have a specific instance of a more general idea as long as you describe the specific instance well.

If you stick to these rules, rather than a massive textbook you will have a searchable, connected technical knowledge base from first principles. Now that's powerful.
