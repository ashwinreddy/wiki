The general philosophy of this wiki is to contain detailed notes on subjects of intellectual inquiry (as opposed to opinions or personal ponderings). In a sense, it will be somewhat like Wikipedia, but with writing that makes sense because they come from me. Keep the following in mind:

2. **Feel confident that the ideas here are true.** It's okay to be wrong else where, but give yourself at least one place where you can trust your knowledge.
3. **Don't generalize prematurely**. It's okay to have a specific instance of a more general idea as long as you describe the specific instance well.
4. **Avoid turtles all the way down**. Start defining relevant ideas where it's natural to start. You don't have to reach down to first principles every time.
5. **Don't expand a topic into its own article until you need to.**

If you stick to these rules, rather than a massive textbook you will have a searchable, connected technical knowledge base from first principles. Now that's powerful.
