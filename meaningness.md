_[meaningness](https://meaningness.com/)_ is a book describing the eponymous quality of having meaning as well as the study of this quality and a [[stance]] that acknowledges it. 

When we talk about the meaning of _X_, we are employing a [[metaphor]] between _X_ and [[language]] acts (this is an idea in [[vervaeke]]'s work also). For example, a sentence has meaning insofar as it talks about something in a sensible, coherent fashion so that all the parts hang together logically. 

meaningness is a phenomenon of [[emergence]]. One phoneme or syllable lacks meaning on its own just as an atom lacks meaning. Thus, meaning arises when the atoms are put together in sensible but interesting ways. 

meaningness is multidimensional: purpose, personal value, ethics, sacredness, etc.

empirically, people rate meaningness when they have [[flow]] states.
