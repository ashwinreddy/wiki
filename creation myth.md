creation myths are [[myth]]s about the creation of the world. for example, tolkien in the _silmarillion_. 

creation myths can be found in [[bible]], [[metamorphoses]] book 1, hesiod's theogony, etc.

myths try to explain the world around us, resolving the fundamental [[paradox]]es with imagination, intuition, and feelings. of course, early peoples were smart enough to make sharp observations about the sun, water, etc. there's also often an emphasis on thought as the initial force of creation. 

1. primeval abyss
2. the original god
3. brooding over the water
4. cosmic egg
5. the sacred word
6. life from the corpse of a god

there is a deep connection between myths and rituals.
