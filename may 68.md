may 68 was a political revolt in france by students.

claire colebrook writes about [[deleuze]] that

> the political problem of may 1968 was whether there could be an active political theory, a way of defining power and revolution that did not rely on already given moral oppositions, such as the opposition between (evil) [[capitalism]] and (innocent) workers.


she also describes the usual account of the problem of may 68 for [[philosophy]].

1. there were 2 dominant philosophies after ww2.
2. [[existentialism]] as expounded by [[sartre]] said we are free to form ourselves.
3. [[phenomenology]] said the world depends on our own senses and meaning.
4. thus, life seemed a creative, historical project compatible with [[marxism]].
5. so we'd have to recognize that we decide how economies are run.
6. with 1968, there was an overturning of this [[humanism]]. [[post-structuralism]] looked at non-rational thought, chance disruptions, non-identity, and a more radical sense of freedom.
7. the [[virtual]] (images, desires, concepts) became recognized as well.
