> all life is problem solving. all organisms are inventors and technicians, good or not so good, successful or not so successful, in solving technical problems. This is how it is among animals - spiders, for example. human technology solves human problems such as sewage disposal, or the storage and supply of food and water, as, for example, bees already have to do. -- [[karl popper]]

the word _problem_ comes from [[greek]] meaning a thing thrown or put forward. it's an apt [[metaphor]]: problems are obstacles, something in the way. a response to a problem is a [[technology]]. 

the philosophical school of [[pragmatism]] asks us to accept that we've got problems and to use thinking to resolve them, but it was [[deleuze]] who developed a notion of the problem (v. "how do we recognize problems?" by audrey wasser) as [[singularity]], [[event]], [[sense]]. claire colebrook writes

> a [[multiplicity]] of highly different factors prompts the creation of a response. for deleuze a 'problem' is not a simple question that needs to find an answer; a problem is something that disrupts life and thinking, producing movements and responses. even molecular life proceeds by way of problems; all evolution and social-historical movement needs to be understood by way of the problem which is its motor.

recall that in _[[what is philosophy?]]_ deleuze and guattari say that [[concept]]s are only created as a function of problems. 

the formulation of the problem is important because

> a solution always has the truth it deserves according to the problem to which it is a response. 

thus, it is less important to deteremine whether the question or answer is true or false than it is to orient the problem. 

first, then, a problem has to have some objective status. the problem is a literal [[paradox]] that disrupts our common sense, our worn-out stories. in addition, there is no transcendent way to judge a problem's truth or falsity. the problem shapes the thought itself so that the problem's truth or falsity must be judged instrinsically -- a question of legitimate or illegitimate use. [[bergson]] points out that stating the problem is a creative act. 

problems serve as laboratories for their solutions. they are signs of a form of life, of an ethos. a false problem expresses one's character.

dialectic, intuition, perspective, [[critique]] as discovery of false problems.
