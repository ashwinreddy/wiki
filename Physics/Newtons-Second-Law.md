Newton's Second Law is the bedrock of classical mechanics, mathematically represented with the formula

\begin{equation}
F=ma
\end{equation}

where $F$ is the net force on a point mass, $m$ is the inertial mass, and $a$ is the net acceleration of the object.



# Variants

Newton's Second Law can be readily transformed into variants which may make certain problems easier.

## Systems

$$
\sum \vec{F} = M\ddot{\vec{r}}_{\text{com}}
$$

## Work and Energy

\begin{equation}
W = \Delta{U} + \Delta{K}
\end{equation}
