Newton's Second Law is the bedrock of classical mechanics, mathematically represented with the formula

\begin{equation}
F=ma
\end{equation}

where $F$ is the net force on a point mass, $m$ is the inertial mass, and $a$ is the net acceleration of the object.

# Reformulations

Newton's Second Law can be readily transformed into variants which may make certain problems easier.

## Work and Energy

$$
W = \Delta{U} + \Delta{K}
