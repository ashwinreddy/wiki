**Electric potential** is [[electric potential energy]] per unit [[electric charge]].

\begin{equation}
V(\vec{r}) = \frac{U_e(\vec{r})}{q}
\end{equation}

Knowing how (electric) force and (electric) potential energy are related, it becomes clear that

$$
V = - \int_C \mathbf{E} \cdot \dd{\mathbf{\ell}}
$$
