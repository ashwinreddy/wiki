**Gauss's law** says that the flux of the [[electric field]] over a surface is proportional to the enclosed [[electric charge]].

\begin{equation}
Q_{\mathsf{enclosed}} / \varepsilon_0 = \oint \mathbf{E}\cdot\dd{\mathbf{A}}
\end{equation}

In differential form, it says the [[divergence]] is [[charge density]] proportional.

$$
\nabla\cdot \mathbf{E} = \rho / \varepsilon_0
$$
