The **magnetic vector potential** $\vec{A}$ is a mathematical construction of [[vector field]] that generates the [[magnetic field]] through a [[curl]].

\begin{equation}
\vec\nabla \times \vec{A} = \vec{B}
\end{equation}

However, we are free to choose what we want $\vec\nabla\cdot\vec{A}$ to be, and the choice is called **fixing the gauge**.
