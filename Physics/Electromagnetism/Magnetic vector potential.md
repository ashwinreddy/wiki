The **magnetic vector potential** is a kind of artificial potential in the form of a [[vector field]] we can give to the [[magnetic field]]. In particular, it generates the [[magnetic field]] through a [[curl]].

\begin{equation}
\nabla \times \mathbf{A} = \mathbf{B}
\end{equation}

In essence, this is a mathematical trick enabled by the no-monopole rule $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0$.

However, we are free to choose what we want $\nabla\cdot\mathbf{A}$ to be, and the choice is called **fixing the gauge**. It can help us write [[Maxwell's equations]] nicely.
