The **magnetic vector potential** $\mathbf{A}$ is a mathematical construction of [[vector field]] that generates the [[magnetic field]] through a [[curl]].

\begin{equation}
\nabla \times \mathbf{A} = \mathbf{B}
\end{equation}

However, we are free to choose what we want $\nabla\cdot\mathbf{A}$ to be, and the choice is called **fixing the gauge**. It can help us write [[Maxwell's equations]] nicely.
