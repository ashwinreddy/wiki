The **magnetic vector potential** is a kind of artificial potential in the form of a [[vector field]] we can give to the [[magnetic field]]. In particular, it generates the [[magnetic field]] through a [[curl]].

\begin{equation}
\nabla \times \mathbf{A} \equiv \mathbf{B}
\end{equation}



Then,

$$
\mathbf{E} = -\nabla \phi - \pdv{\mathbf{A}}{t}
$$

However, we are free to choose what we want $\nabla\cdot\mathbf{A}$ to be, and the choice is called **fixing the gauge**. It can help us write [[Maxwell's equations]] nicely.
