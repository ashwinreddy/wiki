A **Galilean transformation** between two [[reference frames|frame of reference]] translates between their [[coordinate systems|coordinate system]] in Newtonian mechanics. Since Newtonian mechanics operates over absolute time, the two observers can only disagree on position. For a uniform relative velocity $v$,

\begin{align}
x' &= x - vt \\\\\
y' &= y \\\\\
z' &= z \\\\\
t' &= t
\end{align}
