**Generalized coordinates** for a $N$ DOF system are coordinates $q_1, \dots, q_N$. Then the **generalized velocities** are $\dot{q}_1, \dots, \dot{q}_N$. 

Let us assume that we have a conservative force so that we can just use potential $U$. Newton's second law would then say

$$
-\pdv{U}{q} = \dv{}{t}\left(\right)
$$
