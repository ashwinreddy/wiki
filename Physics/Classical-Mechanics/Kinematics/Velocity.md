For a point with position $\vec{r}(t)$, the **velocity** describes the rate of change of $\vec{r}$ over time.

The average velocity $\vec{\bar{v}}$ is given by

$$
\vec{\bar{v}} = \frac{\Delta \vec{r}}{\Delta t}
$$

The instantaneous velocity would require us to look at an infinitesimal amount of time, $\vec{v}$

$$
\vec{v} = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0}\frac{\Delta \vec{r}}{\Delta t} = \dv{\vec{r}(t)}{t}
$$
