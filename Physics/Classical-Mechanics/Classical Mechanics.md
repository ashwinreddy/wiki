**Classical mechanics** is Newtonian mechanics. The experimental facts [@vogtmann2013mathematical] are

1. Space is [[Euclidean space]], which we could denote $E(3)$ and time is one-dimensional.
2. Every [[inertial reference frame]] obeys the (same) laws of nature.
3. Coordinate systems in uniform rectilinear motion with respect to an inertial one are themselves inertial.
4. The initial state of a mechanical system uniquely determine the motion
