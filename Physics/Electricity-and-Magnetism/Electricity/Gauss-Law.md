**Gauss's Law** says that for an [electric field](electric field) $\vec{E}$,

\begin{equation}
\oint{\vec{E}\cdot\mathrm{d}\vec{A}} = \frac{q_{\text{enclosed}}}{\kappa\epsilon_0}.
\end{equation}

### Differential Form

Gauss's Law is the integral form of Maxwell's First Equation, which is written in differential form as
\begin{equation}
\vec\nabla\cdot\vec{E} = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0},
\end{equation}
where $\rho$ is the charge density in space.
