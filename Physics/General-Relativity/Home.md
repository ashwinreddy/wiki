Three underlying ideas:

- Spacetime can be described as a curved, four-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian manifold
- At every point in spacetime is a locally inertial reference frame
- Particles follow geodesics through a spacetime curved by mass

\begin{equation}
G_{\mu\nu} +\Lambda g_{\mu\nu}= \kappa T_{\mu\nu}
