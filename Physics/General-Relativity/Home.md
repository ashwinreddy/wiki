**General relativity** is the most accurate way of describing gravity, mathematically encoded in the [[Einstein Field Equations]].






In Newtonian mechanics, a gravitational force is constructed whose magnitude is proportional to the masses involved. As a result, a mass subjected only to a gravitational force will experience an acceleration equal to the local gravitational field:

\\[
\vec{F} = m\vec{a} \\\
\vec{F}_g = m\vec{a} \\\
m\vec{g}=m\vec{a} \\\
\vec{g}=\vec{a}
\\]

This suggests something special about the gravitational force. Einstein actually concluded that the better way of understanding this phenomenon is to imagine that space is curved so that gravity **is** just acceleration.

Three underlying ideas:

- Spacetime can be described as a curved, four-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian manifold
- At every point in spacetime is a locally inertial reference frame
- Particles follow geodesics through a spacetime curved by mass

> Spacetime is a four-dimensional topological manifold with a smooth atlas carrying a torsion-free connection compatible with a Lorentzian metric and a time orientation satisfying the Einstein equations.
