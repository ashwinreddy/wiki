**General relativity** is the most accurate way of describing gravity, mathematically encoded in the [[Einstein Field Equations]], which concluded that space is curved so that gravity is just acceleration. In other words, the local structure of spacetime is that of special relativity.

- Spacetime can be described as a curved, four-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian manifold
- At every point in spacetime is a locally inertial reference frame
- Particles follow geodesics through a spacetime curved by mass

> Spacetime is a four-dimensional topological manifold with a smooth atlas carrying a torsion-free connection compatible with a Lorentzian metric and a time orientation satisfying the Einstein equations.
