For timeline paths, proper time measures the time elapsed on a physical clock carried along the path.

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{d}\tau = \pm \frac{\mathrm{d}s}{c}
\end{equation}

Proper time is defined in general relativity as follows: Given a pseudo-Riemannian manifold with a local coordinates $x^μ$ and equipped with a metric tensor $g_{μν}$, the proper time interval Δτ between two events along a timelike path P is given by the line integral

\begin{equation}
\Delta \tau =\int_{P}\,d\tau =\int_{P}{\frac{1}{c}}{\sqrt  {\pm g_{{\mu \nu }}\;dx^{\mu }\;dx^{\nu }}}.	
\end{equation}
