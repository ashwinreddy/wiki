The **Einstein Field Equations** (EFE) comprise a set of 10 nonlinear partial differential equations describing gravity. They may be written in the form


\\[
{\displaystyle G_{\mu\nu} +\Lambda g_{\mu \nu }={\frac {8\pi G}{c^{4}}}T_{\mu \nu }}
\\]

where $G_{\mu\nu}$ is the [[Einstein tensor]], $g_{\mu\nu}$ is the [[metric tensor]], and $T_{\mu\nu}$ is the [[stress-energy tensor]], and $\Lambda$ is the [[cosmological constant]].
