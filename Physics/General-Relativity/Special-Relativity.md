Special relativity takes place on a pseudo-Euclidean manifold known as Minkowski spacetime.

$$
\eta_{\mu\nu} = \begin{bmatrix}
-1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\
0 & 1 &  0 & 0 \\\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

The description of Minkowski spacetime using the metric is equivalent to one using line elements:

$$
ds^2 = \eta_{\mu\nu}d{x}^\mu d{x}^\nu
$$

We define proper time by

$$
d{\tau}^2 = -ds^2
$$

1. Principle of relativity (Galileo): No experiment can measure the absolute velocity of an observer; the results of any experiment performed by an observer do not depend on his speed relative to other observers who are not involved in the experiment.

2. Universality of the speed of light (Einstein): The speed of light relative to any unac- celerated observer is c = 3 × 108 m s−1, regardless of the motion of the light’s source relative to the observer. Let us be quite clear about this postulate’s meaning: two differ- ent unaccelerated observers measuring the speed of the same photon will each find it to be moving at 3 × 108 m s−1 relative to themselves, regardless of their state of motion relative to each other.
