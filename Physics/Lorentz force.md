The **Lorentz force** is the force caused by electromagnetic effects. The force on a particle with [[electric charge]] $q$ and [[velocity]] $\vec{v}$ in an [[electric field]] $\mathbf{E}$ and [[magnetic field]] $\mathbf{B}$ is given by

\begin{equation}
\vec{F} = q\left(\vec{E} + \vec{v}\times\vec{B}\right)
\end{equation}
