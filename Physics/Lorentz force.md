The **Lorentz force** is the force caused by electromagnetic effects. The force on a particle with [[electric charge]] $q$ and [[velocity]] $\mathbf{v}$ in an [[electric field]] $\mathbf{E}$ and [[magnetic field]] $\mathbf{B}$ is given by

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{F} = q\left(\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B}\right)
\end{equation}
