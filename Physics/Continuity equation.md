In E&M, continuity is an extension of conservation of charge with the following equation

$$
\pdv{\rho}{t} = - \nabla \cdot \vec\jmath,
$$

where $\rho$ is the [[charge density]] and $\vec\jmath$ is the [[current density]]. If we [[integrate|integral]] and use the [[divergence theorem]], then

$$
\pdv{}{t} Q = - \oint_S \vec\jmath \cdot \dd{\vec{A}}
$$
