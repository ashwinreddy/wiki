The **Galilean Transformations** describe the relationship between two inertial reference frames, given that the laws of physics apply in all inertial reference frames. If one inertial frame is moving at a constant velocity $v$ with respect to the other, then

\begin{align}
x' &= x-vt \\\
y' &= y \\\
z' &= z \\\
t' &= t
\end{align}
