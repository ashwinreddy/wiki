**Time dilation** is the idea that moving fast slows time. For a light clock with distance $L$, an observer seeing the light clock move with velocity $v$ will measure length $L'$ in duration $\Delta t_s$ given by [[Pythagorean theorem]]

\begin{equation}
L^2 + \left(v \Delta t_s\right)^2 = {L'}^2
\end{equation}
