**Time dilation** is the idea that moving fast slows time. Alice, moving at speed $v$ relative to Bob, will measure a time $\Delta t$ that is larger than Bob's time $\Delta t_0$ by the [[Lorentz factor]]

\begin{equation}
\Delta t = \gamma \Delta t_0 \tag{Time Dilation}
\end{equation}


# Proof

A light clock of height $h$ moving at constant velocity $v$ will be seen as having travelled distance $L$ on a "tick" of the clock. Clearly, the observer moving with the light clock measures the height as

$$
h = c \Delta t_0
$$

But the observer at rest will see that

$$
L = c \Delta t
$$
