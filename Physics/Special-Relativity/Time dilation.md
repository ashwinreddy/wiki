**Time dilation** is the idea that moving fast slows time. Somebody moving at speed $v$ will measure a time $\Delta t$ that is larger than the resting time $\Delta t_0$ by the [[Lorentz factor]]

$$
\Delta t = \gamma \Delta t_0
$$





For a light clock with distance $L$, an observer seeing the light clock move with velocity $v$ will measure length $L'$ in duration $\Delta t_s$ given by [[Pythagorean theorem]]

\begin{equation}
L^2 + \left(v \Delta t_s\right)^2 = {L'}^2
\end{equation}
