The **Lorentz factor** is a mathematical expression that describes how much [[time dilates|time dilation]] for somebody moving at a speed $v$. In fact, what matters is the ratio of speed to speed of light, known as speed parameter.

Speed parameter
: The velocity as a percent of speed of light: $\beta = \frac{v}{c}$


\begin{equation}
\gamma \triangleq {1 \over \sqrt{1 -\beta^2}}
\end{equation}
