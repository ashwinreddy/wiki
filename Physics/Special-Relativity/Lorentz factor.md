The **Lorentz factor** is a mathematical expression that describes how much [[time dilates|time dilation]] for somebody moving at a speed $s$. In fact, what matters is the ratio of speed to speed of light, known as speed parameter.

Speed parameter
: The speed written as a percent of speed of light: $\beta = \frac{s}{c}$

The postulates of special relativity tell us that the speed parameter $0 \leq s \leq 1$. 


\begin{equation}
\gamma \triangleq {1 \over \sqrt{1 -\beta^2}}\tag{Lorentz factor}
\end{equation}

As a result, $\gamma \geq 1$.
