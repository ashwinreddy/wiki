The **Lorentz factor** tells you how much longer a second will feel if you're moving at speed $v$. 


\begin{equation}
\gamma \triangleq {1 \over \sqrt{1 -\beta^2}}\tag{Lorentz factor}
\end{equation}

In fact, what matters is the ratio of speed to speed of light, known as speed parameter.

Speed parameter
: The speed written as a percent of speed of light: $\beta = \frac{s}{c}$

The [[postulates|special relativity#postulates]] of special relativity tell us that the speed parameter $s$ must be in the [[unit interval]].



As a result, $\gamma \geq 1$ with equality when the speed is zero.
