Postulates:

- There is no experiment you can do to distinguish between moving and stationary reference frames
- There is no experiment you can do to measure $c$ to be anything but $3.0 \times 10^8$ meters / second

\begin{align}
\Delta x &= \gamma\left(\Delta x'+v_f \Delta t'\right) \\\
\Delta t &= \gamma\left(\Delta t' + \frac{v_f}{c^2}\Delta x'\right) 
\end{align}
