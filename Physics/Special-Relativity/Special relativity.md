**Special relativity** is based on two postulates:

* _Principle of relativity_ (Galileo): The laws of physics are invariant in all inertial frames of reference.
* _Universal speed of light_ (Einstein): Two unaccelerated observers measuring the same photon would find it's speed to be $c$ regardless of their state of motion relative to each other.


Classical mechanics follows the principle of relativity: Newton's laws are invariant to

$$
\vec{v}(t) = \vec{v}'(t) = \vec{v}(t) - \vec{V}
$$
