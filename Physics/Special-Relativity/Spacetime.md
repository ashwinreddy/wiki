**Spacetime** welds 3-dimensional space and one-dimensional time into 4-dimensional [[manifold]].

# Spacetime/Lorentz Interval

The [[postulates|special relativity#postulates]] of special relativity tell us that $c$ is constant. So if we have two events: light being emitted (event A) and light being received (event B), everybody will agree that

\begin{gather}
\text{distance light covered} = \Delta ct \\\\\
\left(\Delta x\right)^2 + \left(\Delta y\right)^2 + \left(\Delta z\right)^2 = \left( \Delta ct\right)^2
\end{gather}
