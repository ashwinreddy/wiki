Principle of relativity
: Laws of nature are the same in all [[inertial reference frames]]

There is no experiment that you can do to distinguish between a stationary and moving reference frame.

Why didn't the principle of relativity apply to light?

1. Maybe principle of relativity only applies to non-electromagnetic things
2. Maybe Maxwell was wrong
3. Principle of relativity correct, and Galilean relativity a special case
