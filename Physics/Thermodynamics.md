# Zeroth Law
Thermal equilibrium between systems is a transitive relation

# First Law

The total energy of an isolated system is constant over time

# Second Law

The total entropy of an isolated system can never decrease over time. Every energy transfer increases the entropy of the universe.

# Third Law

The entropy of a system approaches a constant value as its temperature approaches absolute zero
