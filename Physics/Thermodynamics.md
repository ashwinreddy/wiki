# Zeroth Law
Thermal equilibrium between systems is a transitive relation

# First Law

The total energy of an isolated system is constant over time

# Second Law

The total entropy of an isolated system can never decrease over time. Every energy transfer increases the entropy of the universe.

\begin{equation}
\Delta S_{\text{universe}} = \Delta S_{\text{system}} + \Delta S_{\text{surroundings}} > 0
\end{equation}

# Third Law

The entropy of a system approaches a constant value as its temperature approaches absolute zero
