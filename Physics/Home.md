Physics is, perhaps reductively, the study of motion. Motion occurs all around us, so by studying motion we get a sense for what makes the world tick. The general goal of physics seems to be fundamentally understanding the smallest moving parts of our universe.

Physics is closely related with mathematics, and often developments in one area will lead to developments in the other. As a science, physics demands that we make measurements and test hypotheses. The most natural, simple, and fundamental measurements relate to physical motion: measuring length and timing duration.
