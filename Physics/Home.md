Physics is, perhaps reductively, the study of motion. Motion occurs all around us, so by studying motion we get a sense for what makes the world tick. The general goal of physics seems to be fundamentally understanding the smallest moving parts of our universe.

Physics is closely related with mathematics, and often developments in one area will lead to developments in the other.
