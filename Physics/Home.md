Physics is, perhaps reductively, the study of motion. Motion occurs all around us, so by studying motion we get a sense for what makes the world tick. However, the goal of understanding motion leads us to questions down to the smallest and largest systems in our universe: from atoms to galaxies. The general goal of physics seems to be fundamentally understanding all the moving parts of our universe.

Physics is closely related with mathematics, and often developments in one area will lead to developments in the other. As a science, physics demands that we make measurements and test hypotheses. The most natural, simple, and fundamental measurements relate to physical motion: measuring length and timing duration.

However, it is important to notice that every equation in physics needs to have a physical interpretation, a claim about something measurable in the real world (if enough contextual variables are provided), which is a condition that math need not satisfy.
