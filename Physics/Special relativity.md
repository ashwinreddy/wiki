**Special relativity** has two postulates: all inertial frames are equal, and the speed of light is constant. By the second postulate, we can say that if Alice and Bob see light go from point $A$ to $B$ (in a vacuum) then


$$
\frac{d_{AB}}{\Delta t} = \frac{d'_{AB}}{\Delta t'} = c
$$

It generalizes [[Galilean relativity]]. Consequence means that [[speed]] is bounded at $c$.
