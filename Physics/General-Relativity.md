The theory of **General relativity** posits that the gravitational phenomenon is not simply a force, but that it is a reflection of a warped spacetime. In the words of John Wheeler,

> Matter tells spacetime how to curve. Spacetime tells matter how to move.

# Einstein Equation

$$
G_{\mu\nu} \equiv R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2}g_{\mu\nu}R
$$

\begin{equation}
{\displaystyle R_{\mu \nu }-{\tfrac {1}{2}}R\,g_{\mu \nu }+\Lambda g_{\mu \nu }={\frac {8\pi G}{c^{4}}}T_{\mu \nu }}
\end{equation}


# Vaccum Solutions

In a vacuum,

\begin{equation}
R_{\mu\nu} = 0
\end{equation}
