The theory of **General relativity** posits that the gravitational phenomenon is not simply a force, but that it is a reflection of a warped spacetime. In the words of John Wheeler,

> Matter tells spacetime how to curve. Spacetime tells matter how to move.

The theory is summarized by the Einstein equation

\begin{equation}
G_{\mu\nu} = 8\pi G T_{\mu\nu}
\end{equation}
