The **magnetic field** $\mathbf{B}$ describes the magnetic influence on electrical charge. You will recall that there is no such thing as magnetic charge:

\begin{equation}
\nabla\cdot\mathbf{B} = 0
\end{equation}

All magnetic field lines are loops. However, the magnetic field curls arround currents.

\begin{equation}
\nabla\times\mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{j} + \mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \pdv{\mathbf{E}}{t}
\end{equation}
