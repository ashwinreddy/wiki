The **magnetic field** or **magnetic flux density** $\mathbf{B}$ describes the magnetic influence on electrical charge. It is defined so that the [[Lorentz force]] equation holds. You will recall that there is no such thing as magnetic charge:

\begin{equation}
\nabla\cdot\mathbf{B} = 0
\end{equation}

Thus, all magnetic field lines are loops. However, the magnetic field curls around currents and changes in the [[electric field]].

\begin{equation}
\nabla\times\mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{j} + \frac{1}{c^2}\pdv{\mathbf{E}}{t}
\end{equation}
