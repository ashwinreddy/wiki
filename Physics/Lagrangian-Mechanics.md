**Lagrangian Mechanics** are a reformulation of Newtonian Mechanics that generates the equations of motion just from tracking energy. The Lagrangian is defined as 

$$
\mathcal{L} = K - U
$$

The equations of motion fall out from the Euler-Lagrange equation:

$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial q} = \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \dot{q}}
$$
