**Work** is a change in [[energy]]. The work done by net force is a change in [[kinetic energy]].

\begin{equation}
\sum_i W_i = \Delta K
\end{equation}

The work done by [[force]] $\vec{F}$ along path $C$ is given by a [[line integral]].

\begin{equation}
W = \int_C \vec{F} \cdot \dd{\vec{r}}
\end{equation}

$$
W = \int_{\Delta t} \vec{F}\cdot\vec{v}\\,\dd{t}
$$
