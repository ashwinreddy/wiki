The **Lorentz factor** tells you how much many seconds pass for a runner when his coach measures one second on his stopwatch. This factor depends on one measurement only: the runner's [[speed]] as a fraction of the speed of light. Therefore, it is natural to define the quantity

\begin{equation}
\beta \doteq \frac{v}{c}
\end{equation}

The Lorentz factor is given by the expression below, a derivation for which can be found in the [[time dilation]] article.

\begin{equation}
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}}
\end{equation}

At low speeds (meaning $v \ll c$), the value of $\beta$ is close to 0. Then,

$$
\lim_{\beta \to 0} \gamma = 1,
$$

which explains why we don't really see the effects of the Lorentz factor in everyday life.
