The **Lorentz factor** tells you how much many seconds pass for a runner when his coach measures one second on his stopwatch. This factor depends on one measurement only: the runner's speed as a fraction of the speed of light. Therefore, it is natural to define the quantity

\begin{equation}
\beta = v/c
\end{equation}

The Lorentz factor is given by the expression below, a derivation for which can be found in the [[time dilation]] article.

\begin{equation}
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}}
\end{equation}
