The **electric field** $\vec{E}$ tells us the directions and force per unit charge in which a positive charge would move in space. In other words, it is set up so that you can calculate the Coulomb force just by multiplying the charge of a given particle:

\begin{equation}
\vec{F}_e = q\vec{E}(\vec{r})
\end{equation}

Maxwell's equations tell us how to determine $\vec{E}$ in space.
