The **electric field** $\mathbf{E}$ is a [[vector field]] that tells us the directions and force per unit [[electric charge]] in which a positive charge would move in space. In other words, it is set up so that you can calculate the Coulomb force just by multiplying the charge of a given particle:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{F}_e = q\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r})
\end{equation}

Maxwell's equations tell us how to determine $\mathbf{E}$ in space.
