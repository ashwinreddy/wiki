The Schrodinger Equation is for quantum mechanics what Newton's Second Law was for Classical Mechanics. In fact, we can think of the parts of the Schrodinger equation as a variation on the work-energy theorem, which came from Newton's Second Law. The least handwavy approach is to use the [Hamiltonian][Hamiltonian Mechanics]. 

We'll define the momentum operator $\tilde{p} = \frac{\hbar}{\iota}\nabla$. Then,

$$
\mathcal{H}  &= \tilde{T} + \tilde{V}
$$
$$
= \frac{\tilde{p}^2}{2m} + \tilde{V}
$$
$$
= -\frac{\hbar}{2m}\nabla^2 + \tilde{V}
$$
