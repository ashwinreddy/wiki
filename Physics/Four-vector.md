A **four-vector** is a way of describing space and time using the same coordinate system. The position $x$ is now defined as

$$
x \equiv \begin{bmatrix}
x^0 = ct \\\
x^1 = x \\\
x^2 = y \\\
x^3 = z
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Since $c$ is agreed upon by all observers, it is a suitable choice for converting time into a spatial coordinate.
