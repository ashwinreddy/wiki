**Lagrangian mechanics** is a reformulation of classical mechanics. Suppose $M$ is the [[configuration space]]. To every path $\gamma: \RR \to M$ we assign an [[action]] by the functional

$$
\Phi(\gamma) \triangleq \int_{t_0}^{t_1} L(\dot\gamma) \dd{t}
$$

The stationary solution is given by the [[Euler-Lagrange equation]].
