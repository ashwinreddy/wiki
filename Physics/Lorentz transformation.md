The **Lorentz transformation** tells you how to change your coordinate system to a friend's (in a manner consistent with special relativity). At low velocities, the [[Lorentz factor]] is near 1 and the additional terms are near 0.

\begin{align}
x' &= \gamma(x-vt) \\\\\
t' &= \gamma(t-vx/c^2)
\end{align}
