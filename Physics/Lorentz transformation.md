A **Lorentz transformation** translates between [[coordinate systems|coordinate system]] that are moving at constant velocities relative to each other. The transformation is linear so can be captured by a matrix $\Lambda$. Then,

$$
X' = \Lambda X
$$

The transformation must keep the [[spacetime interval|Spacetime#spacetime interval]] the same. In other words, we require that it satisfy the following, where $\eta$ is the [[Minkowski metric]].

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:lorentz-condition}
\eta = \Lambda^\mathsf{T} \eta \Lambda
\end{equation}


The set of transformations forms the [[Lorentz group]].

# Properties

* If we take the [[determinant]] of \ref{eq:lorentz-condition},
\begin{equation}
1 = (\det \Lambda)^2 \implies \det \Lambda = \pm 1
\end{equation}
