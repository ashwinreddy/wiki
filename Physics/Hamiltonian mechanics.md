**Hamiltonian mechanics** reframes Newtonian mechanics by focusing on the evolution of the Hamiltonian $H(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{p}, t)$, the total energy in the system at time $t$ as a function of generalized coordinates $q_i$ and conjugate momenta $p_i$.

The total energy is symbolically described by

$$
H = \frac{p^2}{2m} + V(x)
$$

\begin{align}
\dot{\mathbf{p}} &=- \pdv{H}{\mathbf{q}} \\\\\ \dot{\mathbf{q}} &= +\pdv{H}{\mathbf{p}}
\end{align}



Equivalent to the [[Euler\-Lagrange equation]].
