**Hamiltonian mechanics** is a formulation of Newtonian mechanics where the equations of motion follow from the Hamiltonian

$$
H = p\dot{x} - L.
$$

\begin{gather}
\dot{x} = \pdv{H}{p} \\\\
\dot{p} = -\pdv{H}{x}
\end{gather}

where $L$ is the [[Lagrangian mechanics]]. This makes the Hamiltonian the [[Legendre transformation]].
