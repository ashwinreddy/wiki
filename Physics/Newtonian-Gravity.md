In Newtonian mechanics, a gravitational force is constructed whose magnitude is proportional to the masses involved. As a result, a mass subjected only to a gravitational force will experience an acceleration equal to the local gravitational field:

\\[
\vec{F} = m\vec{a} \\\
\vec{F}_g = m\vec{a} \\\
m\vec{g}=m\vec{a} \\\
\vec{g}=\vec{a}
\\]

This suggests something special about the gravitational force.
