Cases:

- acceleration and velocity are aligned exactly, so the particle speeds up and moves in a straight line
- acceleration and velocity point in roughly the same direction but have an acute angle between them, so the particle has both linear and rotational movement but it speeds up
- acceleration and velocity are completely perpendicular, so there is only rotational motion
- acceleration and velocity are exactly antiparallel, so the particle slows down, stops moving, and then moves in the other direction
- acceleration and velocity point in roughly opposite directions, so there is linear and rotational motion but the particle slows down as well

### Uniform Acceleration Motion
Let $\vec{x}$ be the position vector 

\begin{gather}
\vec{x} = \vec{x}_0 + \vec{v}_0t + \frac{1}{2}\vec{a}t^2 \\\
\vec{v} = \vec{v}_0 + \vec{a}t \\\
\vec{v}\cdot\vec{v} = \vec{v}_0\cdot\vec{v}_0 + 2a\Delta{x} \\\
\vec{x} = \vec{x}_0 + \frac{\vec{v}+\vec{v}_0}{2}t
\end{gather}
