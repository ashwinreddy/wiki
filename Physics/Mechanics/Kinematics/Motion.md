Cases:

- acceleration and velocity are aligned exactly, so the particle speeds up and moves in a straight line
- acceleration and velocity point in roughly the same direction but have an acute angle between them, so the particle has both linear and rotational movement but it speeds up
- acceleration and velocity are completely perpendicular, so there is only rotational motion
- acceleration and velocity are exactly antiparallel, so the particle slows down, stops moving, and then moves in the other direction
- acceleration and velocity point in roughly opposite directions, so there is linear and rotational motion but the particle slows down as well
