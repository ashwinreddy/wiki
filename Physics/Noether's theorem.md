**Noether's theorem says that**

> If a system has a continuous symmetry property, then there are corresponding quantities whose values are conserved in time.

> To every differentiable symmetry generated by local actions there corresponds a conserved current.

\dv{}{s} L(q(s), \dot{q}(s)) = 0 \implies \dv{}{t}\left[ p \dv{q}{s} \right]= 0
