**Noether's theorem says that**

> If a system has a continuous symmetry property, then there are corresponding quantities whose values are conserved in time.

> To every differentiable symmetry generated by local actions there corresponds a conserved current.

Consider a one-parameter family of transformations on $q$ that leaves the Lagrangian invariant

$$
\dv{}{s} L(q(s), \dot{q}(s)) = 0
$$

The conserved quantity is

$$
C = p \dv{q}{s}
$$
