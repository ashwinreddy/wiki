**Noether's theorem says that**

> If a system has a continuous symmetry property, then there are corresponding quantities whose values are conserved in time.

> To every differentiable symmetry generated by local actions there corresponds a conserved current.

Consider a one-parameter family of transformations on $q$ that leaves the Lagrangian invariant

$$
\dv{}{s} L(q(s), \dot{q}(s)) = 0
$$

The conserved quantity is

$$
C = p\cdot\dv{q}{s}
$$

This is because

\begin{align}
\dot{C} &= \dot{p}\dv{q}{s} + p \dv{\dot{q}}{s} \\\\\
&= \pdv{L}{q}\dv{q}{s} + \pdv{L}{\dot{q}} \dv{\dot{q}}{s} \\\\\
&= \dv{}{s}L(q(s), \dot{q}(s)) \\\\\
&= 0
\end{align}
