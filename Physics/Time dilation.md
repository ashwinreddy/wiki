Time dilation 
: Moving fast slows time. 

Alice, moving at speed $v$ relative to Bob, will measure a time $\Delta t > \Delta t_0$ if Bob measures time $\Delta t_0$. The proportionality constant is the Lorentz factor (always > 1)

\begin{equation}
\Delta t = \gamma \Delta t_0 \tag{Time Dilation}
\end{equation}


# Proof

A light clock of height $h$ moving at constant velocity $v$ will be seen as having travelled distance $L$ on a "tick" of the clock. Clearly, the observer moving with the light clock measures the height as

$$
h = c \Delta t_0
$$

But the observer at rest will see that

$$
L = c \Delta t
$$

Consider the right triangle with hypotenuse $L$ and sides $h$ and $v\Delta t$. By the Pythagorean theorem,

\begin{gather\*}
L^2 = v^2 \Delta t^2 + h^2 \\\\\
c^2 \Delta t^2 = v^2 \Delta t^2 + c^2 \Delta t_0^2 \\\\\
\Delta t^2 = \frac{v^2}{c^2} \Delta t^2 + \Delta t_0^2 \\\\\
\Delta t^2 \left(1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}\right) = \Delta t_0^2 \\\\\
\Delta t  = \frac{\Delta t_0}{\sqrt{1 - v^2 / c^2}}
\end{gather\*}
