A **Galilean transformation** translates between a "stationary" reference frame and a "moving" reference frame. The moving frame has primed coordinates. We can always orient the coordinate systems so that the motion is one direction.

\begin{align}
x' &= x - vt \\\\\
y' &= y \\\\\
z' &= z \\\\\
t' &= t
\end{align}
