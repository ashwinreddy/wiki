A **Galilean transformation** translates between a "stationary" reference frame and a "moving" reference frame. The moving frame has primed coordinates. We can always orient the coordinate systems so that the motion is one direction. Then, the only disagreement is in that first coordinate.

\begin{align}
x' &= x - vt \\\\\
y' &= y \\\\\
z' &= z \\\\\
t' &= t
\end{align}
