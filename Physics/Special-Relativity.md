Special relativity describes what happens to objects moving at extremely high speeds. The two postulates of special relativity,

1. The laws of physics are the same for all IRFs
2. The speed of light in a vacuum $c$ is the same for all observers

imply that there is no such thing as absolute time. Once an object has a velocity, it has its own clock and ruler.

# Michelson-Morley Experiment

Since light has wavelike behavior, it must have a medium. But light travels through a vacuum so its not any kind of medium we are familiar with. Scientists proposed a **luminiferous aether** that permeated space, allowing light to travel. Michelson performed an experiment to see if this were true. It turned out that this was not the case: no matter how you construe such an aether, the speed of light seems to be the same even when you would be opposing your previous motion with the aether.

# Light Clock

Imagine a **light clock**, where a light signal starts at the bottom of a box, travels to the top, hits a mirror, and reflects back down to where it started. Now imagine an observer seeing the box move horizontally. The question is whether the observer inside the box and outside disagree on the time it takes for a cycle to complete, and by how much if so. 

The observer inside the box thinks that the time is

$$
\Delta{t}_0
$$

\begin{equation}
\Delta t = \frac{\Delta t_0}{\sqrt{1-(v/c)^2}}
\end{equation}
