Special relativity describes what happens to objects moving at extremely high speeds. The two postulates of special relativity,

1. The laws of physics are the same for all IRFs
2. The speed of light in a vacuum $c$ is the same for all observers

imply that there is no such thing as absolute time. Once an object has a velocity, it has its own clock and ruler.

# Michelson-Morley Experiment

Since light has wavelike behavior, it must have a medium. But light travels through a vacuum so its not any kind of medium we are familiar with. Scientists proposed a **luminiferous aether** that permeated space, allowing light to travel.
