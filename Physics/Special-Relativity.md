# Special Relativity

## Michelson-Morley

If light is a wave, then surely it must have a medium. This hypothetical medium was known as **aether**, and the idea was that it would have to permeate free space. Michelson and Morley tried measuring the speed of light to see if it changed as the earth was moving through this medium, but it turned out to be the same every time.


Postulates of Special Relativity:

1. The laws of physics are the same for observers in all reference frames
2. The speed of light is constant for observers in all reference frames


## Galilean Transformation


An event has both a space and time coordinate.


The following are the Galilean Transformations:

\begin{align}
x\prime &= x - ut \\\
y\prime &= y \\\
z\prime &= z \\\
t\prime &= t
\end{align}

## General Relativity

Curvature of space time sheet is proportional to matter density of earth.
