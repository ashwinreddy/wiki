A **blackbody** is a complex object, simply anything but a gas, that absorbs all electromagnetic energy and radiates it out. The blackbody has what is variously called a blackbody, Planck, continuous, or thermal spectrum. Its absorbance properties also mean that it does not transmit (allow any light to pass through it) or reflect (bounce back any light). The blackbody also obeys Wien's law and the Stefan-Boltzmann law.



need not be black.

An idealized blackbody would absorb all electromagnetic energy. As a result, it would heat up and emit an equal amount of energy, assuming it is in thermal equilibrium. Because of these properties, it would look black. It would not reflect light because it absorbs everything. Nor would it transmit.

A mirror is not a very good black body, but they still absorb some energy. Windows and glass are also not very good black bodies.

Blackbodies have a constant temperature if their absorbance is constant.

Humans and chairs are reasonably good blackbodies. 

Blackbodies would look black.

Stars are decent blackbodies (not great though) because they are not in thermal equilibrium with their surroundings.

The quality of the material as an absorber is indicative of its quality as an emitter.

# Applications

An infrared thermometer uses a Planck spectrum and Wein's law to determine temperature.
