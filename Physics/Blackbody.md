A **blackbody** need not be black.

An idealized blackbody would absorb all electromagnetic energy. As a result, it would heat up and emit an equal amount of energy, assuming it is in thermal equilibrium. Because of these properties, it would look black. It would not reflect light because it absorbs everything. Nor would it transmit.
