A **blackbody** need not be black.

An idealized blackbody would absorb all electromagnetic energy. As a result, it would heat up and emit an equal amount of energy, assuming it is in thermal equilibrium. Because of these properties, it would look black. It would not reflect light because it absorbs everything. Nor would it transmit.

A mirror is not a very good black body, but they still absorb some energy. Windows and glass are also not very good black bodies.

Blackbodies have a constant temperature if their absorbance is constant.

Humans and chairs are reasonably good blackbodies. 

Blackbodies would look black.

The quality of the material as an absorber is indicative of its quality as an emitter.
