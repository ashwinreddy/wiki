1. **The Relativity Postulate**: the laws of physics are the same for all observers in all inertial reference frames. No one frame is preferred over any other.

2. **The Speed of Light Postulate**: the speed of light in a vacuum has the same value in all directions and inertial reference frames.




# Special Relativity

Applies only to IRFs

\begin{equation}
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\end{equation}

If $v\ll{c}$, then $\gamma \approx 1$. $\gamma$ is the **Lorentz factor**.


When you start moving,

- length contracts
- time dilates

\begin{equation}
E = mc^2
\end{equation}

# General Relativity

> Spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve. - John Wheeler
