**Newton's second law** says that the net [[force]] on a [[physical body]] instantaneously changes the body's net [[momentum]] over time.

\begin{equation}
\vec{F} = \dv{\vec{p}}{t}
\end{equation}

For constant mass, this reduces to [[mass]] times [[acceleration]]. Otherwise, we use the [[rocket equation]].

$$
\vec{F} = m\vec{a}
$$

Usually, we treat this as a [[differential equation]] to solve

$$
\frac{\dd{}\^2x}{\dd{t\^2}} = {F \over m}
$$

$$
\ddot{\mathbf{x}} = \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{x}, \dot{\mathbf{x}}, t)
$$

# Potential

Suppose the force is exclusively from a potential $U(q)$. Then,

$$
m\ddot{q}^j = -\pdv{U}{q^j}
$$
