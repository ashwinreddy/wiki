**Newton's second law** says that a [[force]] is the [[time derivative]] of [[momentum]].

\begin{equation}
\vec{F} = \dv{\vec{p}}{t}
\end{equation}

For constant mass, this reduces to [[mass]] times [[acceleration]].

$$
F = ma
$$

Usually, we treat this as a [[differential equation]] to solve

$$
\frac{\dd{}\^2x}{\dd{t\^2}} = {F \over m}
$$
