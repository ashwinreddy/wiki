**Frequency** is the number of times an event occurs in a given time period. If an event occurs every $T$ seconds/minutes/hours/etc., then

$$
f = \frac{1 \text{ cycle}}{T}
$$

The SI unit for frequency is the hertz (Hz), which is one cycle per second. When there is a rotation involved, [[angular frequency]] contains the same information but in terms of [[radian]] per sec.
