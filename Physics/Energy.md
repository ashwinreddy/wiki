**Kinetic energy** is the energy associated with relative motion of objects.

**Thermal energy** is kinetic energy associated with random movement of atoms or molecules. Heat is the transformation of thermal energy from one object to another.

**Potential energy** is energy associated with the state of a system. **Chemical energy** is the potential energy available for release in a chemical reaction.
