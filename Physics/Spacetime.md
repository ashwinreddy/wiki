**Spacetime** is a [[manifold]] that inextricably welds a time [[dimension]] with three spatial dimensions.

# Spacetime interval

The spacetime interval is independent of the inertial frame of reference. The interval between two events $(t_a, x_a, y_a, z_a)$ and $(t_b, x_b, y_b, z_b)$ is given by

$$
\left(\Delta s\right)^2 = -\left(c\Delta t\right)^2 + \left(\Delta x\right)^2 + \left(\Delta y\right)^2 + \left(\Delta z\right)^2
$$
