The personal reference frame is not very useful.

|Quantity|Agreement|
|---------|---------|
| Position| No |
|Displacement| No |
| Velocity | No |
| Acceleration | Yes |
| Mass | Yes |
| Force | Yes |
|Time| Yes |
|Momentum | No |

Who is the one who is moving (the primed reference frame)? It is arbitrary

\begin{equation}
v = 0 \qquad v' = x_0 - v
\end{equation}

Subtract off the speed from both

\begin{equation}
v' = 0 \qquad v = \Omega
\end{equation}
