**Coulomb's law** says that the [[electric force]] obeys an inverse square law.

$$
F_e = k\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}
$$

Realize that Coulomb's law cannot be the full story because it implies that particles arbitrarily far away will instantaneously feel each other's forces, which violates special relativity.
