The **photoelectric** effect describes why light hitting a metal emits electrons. Albert Einstein won a Nobel Prize in Physics for this research.

Imagine a circuit with parallel plates, separated by a distance. When light is shone on one of the plates, a voltage change is observed.

Recall that 

\begin{equation}
U = qV
\end{equation}

In this case, we have an electron, so $q=e$ where $e$ is the charge on an electron. The kinetic energy of our emitted electron is the same as the input energy (the work done with the circuit)

\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = eV
\end{equation}

Einstein hypothesized that there's some binding energy $\Phi$ that keeps electrons locked in. Only if the light's energy is high enough do the electrons get emitted, and only with the difference left when you subtract the binding energy from the light's energy.

\begin{gather}
K = E_{\gamma} - \Phi \\\
eV = h \nu - \Phi \\\
U = \frac{h}{e}\nu - \frac{\Phi}{e}
\end{gather}

The relationship between V and $\nu$ is linear with a negative y-intercept for the binding energy.
