Imagine a circuit with parallel plates, separated by a distance. When light is shone on one of the plates, a voltage change is observed.

\begin{equation}
U = qV
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = eV
\end{equation}

\begin{gather}
K = E_{\gamma} - \Phi \\\
eV = h \nu - \Phi \\\
U = \frac{h}{e}\nu - \frac{\Phi}{e}
\end{gather}

The relationship between V and $\nu$ is linear with a negative y-intercept for the binding energy.
