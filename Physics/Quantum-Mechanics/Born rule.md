The **Born rule** says that for a [[wave function]] $\Psi(x, t)$, the function $| \Psi(x, t) |^2$ represents the [[probability density function]] for finding a particle at $x$ at time $t$. In this way,

$$
\Pr(a \leq x \leq b) = \int_a^b \dd{x} \cdot |\Psi(x, t)|^2
$$

What does this mean experimentally? 

1. If we ran the experiment $N \gg 1$ times in parallel
2. Run it may times with the same set up, resetting each time. Once we measure the position of the particle, the wave function collapses to position eigenstate with 100% probability at $x_0$ forevermore.
