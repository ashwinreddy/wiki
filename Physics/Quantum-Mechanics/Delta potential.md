The **delta potential** is a [[Dirac delta function]]

$$
V(x) = -\alpha \delta(x)
$$

The [[time-independent Schrodinger equation]]:

$$
-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\dd{}^2 \psi}{\dd{x^2}} - \alpha \delta (x) \psi = E\psi
$$

When $x \neq 0$, we have $\delta(x) = 0$ and the general solution is

$$
\psi(x) = A \exp(-\kappa x) + B \exp(\kappa x)
$$

We have both bound states and scattering states.
