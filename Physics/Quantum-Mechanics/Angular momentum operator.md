The **angular momentum operator** is a vector operator $\vec{L} = (L_x, L_y, L_z)$. The [[angular momentum]] in classical mechanics is

$$
\vec{L} = \vec{r} \times \vec{p},
$$

so we adapt them for quantum mechanics appropriately.

\begin{gather}
L_x = yp_z - z p_y \\\\
L_y = zp_x - x p_z \\\\
L_z = x p_y  - y p_x
\end{gather}

It turns out that

\begin{gather}
\vec{L}^2 | \psi \rangle = \hbar^2 \ell (\ell + 1) | \psi \rangle \\\\\
L_z | \psi \rangle = \hbar m | \psi \rangle
\end{gather}


If $V(\vec{r}) = V(r)$, then $L_x$, $L_y$, and $L_z$ are conserved:

$$
[H, L_x] = [H, L_y] = [H, L_z] = 0
$$
