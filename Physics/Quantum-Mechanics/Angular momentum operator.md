The **angular momentum operator** is a vector operator $\vec{L} = (L_x, L_y, L_z)$. The [[angular momentum]] in classical mechanics is

$$
\vec{L} = \vec{r} \times \vec{p},
$$

so we adapt them for quantum mechanics appropriately.

\begin{gather}
L_x = yp_z - z p_y \\\\
L_y = zp_x - x p_z \\\\
L_z = x p_y  - y p_x
\end{gather}
