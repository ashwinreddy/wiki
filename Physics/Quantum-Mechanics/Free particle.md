The **free particle** has stationary states that are _not_ normalizable. 

> There is no such thing as a free particle with definite energy.

But the stationary states are still useful. The general solution to the time-dependent Schrodinger equation is a linear combination of the separable solutions, but it's an integral over a continuous index now.

$$
\Psi(x,t)= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \phi(k)e^{\iota(kx - \omega t)}\dd{k},\quad \omega = \frac{\hbar k^2}{2m}
$$
