**Quantum mechanics** is the physics of small particles. It differs from classical mechanics, which generally corresponds to our physical intuitions more, in the following ways:


|Quantum Mechanics|Classical Mechanics|
|-----------------|-------------------|
|State of system is captured by [[wave function]]|State of system is captured by observable values (position, velocity, etc.)|
|Observables are linear Hermitian operators||
|Superposition: we can add states with arbitrary coefficients|

Since quantum mechanics is fundamentally probabilistic, we import the tools of probability. In addition, quantum mechanics develops its own notation to handle these complexities. For example, we use [[expected value]]

$$
\langle x \rangle = \int \dd{x} \cdot x \rho(x)
$$
