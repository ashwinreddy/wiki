**Quantum mechanics** is the physics of small particles.


|Quantum Mechanics|Classical Mechanics|
|-----------------|-------------------|
|State of system is captured by [[wave function]]|State of system is captured by observable values (position, velocity, etc.)|
|Observables are linear Hermitian operators||
|Superposition: we can add states with arbitrary coefficients|
