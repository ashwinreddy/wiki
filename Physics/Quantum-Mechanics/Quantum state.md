A **quantum state** is a ray in [[Hilbert space]]. We can naturally represent it with a [[ket|bra-ket notation]] $| S(t) \rangle$, but if we want to do concrete computations, we need a basis. The [[wave function]] $\Psi(x, t)$ does this in a position basis:

$$
\Psi(x, t) = \langle x \mid S(t) \rangle
$$

We could also work in momentum space if we wanted.

$$
\Phi(p, t) = \langle p \mid S(t) \rangle
$$
