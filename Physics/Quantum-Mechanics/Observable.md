An **observable** in quantum mechanics is something we can measure, having [[real number]] [[expected value]]. 

> Observables are represented by [[Hermitian operator]].

Consider the observable as an [[operator]] $Q(x, p)$, then

$$
\langle Q \rangle \equiv \langle \Psi \mid \hat{Q} \Psi \rangle
$$

It must then be the case that

$$
\langle Q \rangle = \langle Q \rangle^*
$$
