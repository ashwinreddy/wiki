An **observable** in quantum mechanics is something we can measure. It has to have a [[real number]] [[expected value]]. Consider the observable as an [[operator]] $Q(x, p)$, then

$$
\langle Q \rangle \equiv \langle \Psi \mid \hat{Q} \Psi \rangle
$$

It must then be the case that

$$
\langle Q \rangle = \langle Q \rangle^*
$$

Thus, an observable is a Hermitian operator.
