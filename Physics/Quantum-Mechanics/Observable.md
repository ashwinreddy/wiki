An **observable** in quantum mechanics is something we can measure for a particle, meaning it has [[real|real number]] [[expectation|expected value]]. 

> Observables are represented by [[Hermitian operator]].

Consider the observable as an [[operator]] $Q(x, p)$, then

$$
\langle Q \rangle \equiv \langle \Psi \mid \hat{Q} \Psi \rangle
$$

It must then be the case that

$$
\langle Q \rangle = \langle Q \rangle^*
$$

# Determinate state

A determinate state for an observable $Q$ is one that whenever you measure $Q$, you always get the same value.

> Determinate states of $Q$ are eigenfunctions of $\hat{Q}$.

# Examples

Consider the momentum operator $\widehat{p}$
