A **bound state** is where the potential $V(x)$ exceeds a particle's total energy $E$ on either side so that it cannot escape (hence, bound). 

$$
E < V(-\infty) \text{ and } V(+\infty)
$$

Since real life potentials usually go to zero at infinity, the condition is more like $E < 0$ then.


The  particle can only go back and forth in a potential well. Formally, a bound state is one that is not normalizable.
