**Hydrogen atom** is amenable to a quantum mechanical treatment. [[Coulomb's law]] tells us that

$$
V(r) = -\frac{e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{1}{r}
$$

The allowed energies are

$$
E_n = - \left[\frac{m_e}{2\hbar\^2}\left(\frac{e\^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\right)^2\right]\frac{1}{n^2}
$$

The stationary states are labeled by $|\psi_{n\ell m} \rangle$ where $n$ is the [[principal quantum number]], $\ell$ is the [[orbital quantum number]], and $m$ is the [[magnetic quantum number]].
