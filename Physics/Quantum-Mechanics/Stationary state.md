A **stationary state** is a quantum state $\Psi$ that is a solutions to the time-independent [[Schrodinger equation]]. A slicker description is that it is an [[eigenvector|eigenpairs]] of the [[Hamiltonian]]. 

$$
\hat{H} \Psi = E \Psi
$$

In this case,

$$
\langle H \rangle = \int \Psi^* \hat{H} \Psi \\, \dd{x} = \int \Psi^* E \Psi \\, \dd{x} = E.
$$

$$
\hat{H}^2 \psi = E^2 \psi \implies \left \langle \hat{H}^2 \right \rangle = E^2.
$$

Thus, we have $\sigma^2_E = 0$, so $E$ is the only possible energy the state can have ([[Dirac delta function]]).

# Properties

* Any and all observables from a stationary state are independent of time. 
* The stationary states are orthogonal and complete
