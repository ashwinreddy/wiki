A **stationary state** is a quantum state $\Psi$ that is an [[eigenvector|eigenpairs]] of the [[Hamiltonian]]. Effectively, they are solutions to the time-independent [[Schrodinger equation]]

$$
\hat{H} \Psi = E \Psi
$$

In this case,

$$
\langle H \rangle = \int \Psi^* \hat{H} \Psi \\, \dd{x} = \int \Psi^* E \Psi \\, \dd{x} = E.
$$

Any and all observables from a stationary state are independent of time.
