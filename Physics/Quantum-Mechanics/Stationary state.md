A **stationary state** is a special kind of [[quantum state]] that is useful in solving the time-dependent [[Schrodinger equation]]. In particular, it is the solution to the time-independent Schrodinger equation. Namely, a stationary state's space dependent term $\psi(x)$ is an [[eigenstate|eigenpairs]] of the [[Hamiltonian]]:

$$
\widehat{H} \psi = E\psi
$$

# Properties

Why are stationary states nice and/or useful? 

1. Because nothing ever _happens_ in a stationary state. The wave function $\Psi(x, t)=\psi(x)\varphi(t)$ depends on time, but the probability density $\rho(x,t) = |\psi(x)|^2$ does not.
2. Thus, any expected value will be constant in time.
3. A stationary state has definite total energy: $\sigma_H^2 = 0$.
