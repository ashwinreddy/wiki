Two [[observables|observable]] $A$ and $B$ are **compatible** if any of the following equivalent conditions hold:

a) If you measure $A$, then $B$, then $A$ you get the same measurement for $A$.
b) $A$ and $B$ commute. 

\begin{equation}
[A, B] = 0
\end{equation}

c) $A$ and $B$ have a common eigenbasis.
