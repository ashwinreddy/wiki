**Spin angular momentum**, abbreviated **spin**, is a kind of internal angular momentum for elementary particles. 


The commutation relations are are a carbon copy of the [[angular momentum operator]]

$$
[S_i, S_j] = \iota\hbar \epsilon_{ijk}S_{i}S_{j}
$$




It is related to the eigenvalue of $S^2$ operator in the following way:

$$
S^2 | sm \rangle = \hbar^2 s(s+1) | sm \rangle
$$

The spin quantum number takes on values $s = 0, \frac{1}{2}, 1, \frac{3}{2}, 2, \dots$. The spin angular momentum is then

$$
S = \hbar \sqrt{s(s+1)}
$$

$$
S_z | sm \rangle = \hbar m| sm \rangle
$$

# Addition of Angular Momenta

Suppose you have two particles in state $\mid s_1 m_1 \rangle$ and $\mid s_2 m_2 \rangle$, respectively.
