**Spin angular momentum**, abbreviated **spin**, is a kind of internal angular momentum for elementary particles. It is analogous to motion about the center of mass, like the Earth spinning on its own axis. Of course, this analogy is only good up to a point because the electron is a structureless point, so it seems like particles intrinsically have this kind of momentum. 

The spin quantum number takes on values $s = 0, \frac{1}{2}, 1, \frac{3}{2}, 2, \dots$.

# Commutators

The commutation relations are algebraically a carbon copy of the [[angular momentum operator]]'s:

\begin{gather}
[S_i, S_j] = \iota\hbar \epsilon_{ijk}S_{i}S_{j} \\\\
[S^2, S_i] = 0
\end{gather}

\begin{equation}
S_{\pm} \equiv S_x \pm \iota S_y
\end{equation}


# Eigenstates

The eigenstate of $S^2$ is therefore given by

\begin{gather}
S^2 | sm \rangle = \hbar^2 s(s+1) | sm \rangle
S_z | sm \rangle = \hbar m| sm \rangle
\end{gather}

# Addition of Angular Momenta

Suppose you have two particles in state $\mid s_1 m_1 \rangle$ and $\mid s_2 m_2 \rangle$, respectively.
