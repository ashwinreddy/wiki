The **bra-ket notation** is a notation used in quantum mechanics. Here, a [[vector]] is called a **ket** $\mid a \rangle = \vec{a}$. A **bra** is written as $\langle a \mid$.

The [[inner product]] of kets $| a \rangle$ and $| b \rangle$ is written $\langle a \mid b \rangle$. A linear operator $T$ will act on a ket just like $T \mid a \rangle$.
