**Spin-Â½** is the most important case of [[spin]] $s = \frac{1}{2}$. Then, there are just 2 eigenstates $\left|sm \right\rangle.$, $\left|\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}\rangle\right.$


Such particles have a permanent magnetic moment along the direction of their spin. 

The spin matrices are related to the [[Pauli matrices]] by a constant scalar:

$$
S_i = \frac{\hbar}{2}\sigma_i
$$

\begin{gather}
\hat{S}_z \mid \uparrow \rangle = +\frac{\hbar}{2} \mid \uparrow \rangle \\\\
\hat{S}_z \mid \downarrow \rangle = -\frac{\hbar}{2} \mid \downarrow \rangle
\end{gather}
