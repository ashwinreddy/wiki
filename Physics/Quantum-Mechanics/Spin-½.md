**Spin-Â½** is the most important case of [[spin]] $s = \frac{1}{2}$. Such particles have a permanent magnetic moment along the direction of their spin. 


There are just 2 eigenstates for $s=1/2$ that we could denote $\left|sm \right.\rangle$:

\begin{align}
\mid\uparrow \rangle &\doteq \left|\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}\Bigg\rangle\right. \tag{Spin Up} \\\\
\mid\downarrow \rangle& \doteq \left|\frac{1}{2}\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)\Bigg\rangle\right. \tag{Spin Down}
\end{align}

The spin matrices are related to the [[Pauli matrices]] by a constant scalar:

$$
S_i = \frac{\hbar}{2}\sigma_i
$$

\begin{gather}
\hat{S}_z \mid \uparrow \rangle = +\frac{\hbar}{2} \mid \uparrow \rangle \\\\
\hat{S}_z \mid \downarrow \rangle = -\frac{\hbar}{2} \mid \downarrow \rangle
\end{gather}
