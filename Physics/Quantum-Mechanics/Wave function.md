The **wave function** $\Psi$ is the primary object of study in quantum mechanics. It is a function of [[space]] and [[time]] and contains information about the probability of seeing a particle somewhere.


We will often need to normalize the wave function to interpret the probabilities. We require that

$$
\int_{\RR} \dd{x} \cdot | \Psi(x, t)|^2 = 1
$$
