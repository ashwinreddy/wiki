The **wave function** $\Psi$ is the primary object of study in quantum mechanics. It is a function of [[space]] and [[time]] and contains information about the probability of seeing a particle somewhere.

$$
\rho(x, t) = | \Psi(x, t)|^2
$$

We will often need to normalize the wave function to interpret the probabilities as a [[probability density function]]. We require that

$$
\int_{\RR} \dd{x} \cdot \rho(x, t) = 1
$$

The wave function evolves as the [[Schrodinger equation]].
