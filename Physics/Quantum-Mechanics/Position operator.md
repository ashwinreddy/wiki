The **position operator** is the operator that measures the position of a particle. In one dimension, we take it to be $\widehat{x}$ which acts using multiplication.

Let's see what the [[eigenpairs]] of the operator are if we call the eigenvalue $y$ and its eigenfunction $g_y(x)$.

$$
\hat{x} g_y(x) = yg_y(x)
$$

Let's say the $g_y$ are Dirac orthonormal: 

$$
\langle g_y \mid g_{y'} \rangle = \delta(y - y')
$$

Then,

$$
g_y(x) = \delta(x - y)
$$

$$
\left[\widehat{x}_i, \widehat{H} \right] = \frac{\iota\hbar}{m} \widehat{p}_i
$$
