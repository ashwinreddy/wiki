The **position operator** is the operator that measures the position of a particle. In one dimension, we take it to be $\widehat{x}$ which acts using multiplication.

Let's see what the [[eigenpairs]] of the operator are if we call the eigenvalue $y$ and its eigenfunction $g_y(x)$.

$$
\hat{x} g_y(x) = yg_y(x)
$$
