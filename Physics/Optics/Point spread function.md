The **point spread function (PSF)** describes the response of an imaging system to a point source.  The image $I(x,y)$ of a linear optical system is a weighted sum of PSF over all points $(u,v)$:

$$
I(x,y) = \iint g(u, v) h(x, y; u, v) \dd{u} \dd{v}
$$

where $g(u, v)$ is the object intensity at $(u,v)$, and $h(x, y; u, v)$ is the PSF generated by a point source at $(u,v)$.

# Theory

Suppose our imaging system is modeled as $I = f(g(u,v))$. If $f$ is a [[linear system]], then it is useful to write

$$
g(u, v) = \iint g(\epsilon, \eta) \delta(u - \epsilon, v - \eta) \dd{\epsilon}\\,\dd{\eta},
$$

Therefore,

\begin{align}
f(g(u, v)) &= f\left(\iint g(\epsilon, \eta) \delta(u - \epsilon, v - \eta) \dd{\epsilon}\\,\dd{\eta} \right) \\\\
&=  \iint f\left( g(\epsilon, \eta) \delta(u - \epsilon, v - \eta) \dd{\epsilon}\\,\dd{\eta} \right) 
\end{align}
