The **point spread function (PSF)** describes the response of an imaging system to a point source. 

# Theory

The image of a linear optical system is a weighted sum of PSF over all points $(u,v)$:

$$
I(x,y) = \iint f(u, v) h(x, y; u, v) \dd{u} \dd{v}
$$

where $I$ is the image, $f(u, v)$ is the object intensity at $(u,v)$, and $h(x, y; u, v)$ is the PSF generated by a point source at $(u,v)$.
