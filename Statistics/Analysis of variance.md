**Analysis of variance (ANOVA)**

1. Define the population
2. Set up a null hypothesis and alternate hypothesis
3. Select which hypothesis test to conduct
4. Choose the significance level
5. Calculate the test statistic from the sample data
6. Determine whether the $p$-value for the test statistic obtained in Step 5 is smaller than the significance level
7. Decide whether you can reject the null hypothesis.
