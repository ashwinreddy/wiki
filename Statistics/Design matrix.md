A **design matrix** is a [[matrix]] $\mathbf{X} \in \RR^{n \times d}$ where every column is an explanatory variable and every row is an example.

We may center the matrix by subtracting the mean of each feature column from that column. We can also decorrelate the matrix by rotating to a coordinate system where features have covariance zero.
