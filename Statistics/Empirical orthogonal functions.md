**Empirical orthogonal functions (EOF)** is the jargon oceanographers/atmospheric scientists use for [[PCA|principle component analysis]] with [[time series]] or spatial data, i.e. extracting coherent variations in the data. EOF will produce just a few sets of new time series data from a much larger group, given that the originals are relatively coherent with each other.

The simplest analysis is to compute eigenvectors and eigenvalues from the covariance matrix of the original time series data. This works well if there's no time lag.
