a normal distribution is a continuous [[probability distribution]]. we will denote it $\mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$. the standard normal has mean 0 and variance 1, i.e.

$$
f(x) \propto e\^{-z^2/2}
$$

The general form is

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} \exp\left( -\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} \right)^2 \right)
$$
