**Hypothesis testing** is about trying to fit a model for a set of observations (which is the opposite of usual probability).

# Formalization

You are given some observations $x \sim X$ and told that there is some $\theta^* \in \Theta$ for which the data was drawn as $X \sim \mathbb{P}\_{\theta^*}$, and the task is to determine whether $\theta\^*$ is in $\Theta_0$ or in $\Theta_1$ (which are MECE)
