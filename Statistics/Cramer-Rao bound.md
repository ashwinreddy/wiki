The **Cramer-Rao bound** states that the [[variance]] of a parameter estimator is at least the reciprocal of [[Fisher information]].

$$
\mathbb{V}\left( \hat{\theta}(x) \right) \geqslant \frac{1}{\mathcal{I}_X(\theta)}
$$

When Fisher information is high, it means $\theta$ are easier to estimate, so it's intuitive that the reciprocal bounds the variance of the estimator.
