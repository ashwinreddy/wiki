**Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)** is a method for finding the parameters to a statistical model by evaluating how likely they are to be right.

$$
\hat\theta = \arg\max_{\theta \in \Theta} \hat{L}(\theta ; y)
$$

It can be convenient to use a log likelihood replacement $\ell(\theta; y) = \log L(\theta; y)$.
