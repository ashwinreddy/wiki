**Normalized maximum likelihood** for a [[statistical model]] $M$ is a [[probability distribution]]

$$
p_{\text{NML}} \propto  \max p(x),
$$

where we include a [[normalizing constant]] to make it a proper distribution. 

The NML distribution minimizes regret in the worse case:

$$
p_{\text{NML}} = \argmin_q 
$$
