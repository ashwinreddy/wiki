Raw data is data acquired from experimentation and/or observation.


Processed data includes any changes made to the data informed by looking at the initial data. For example, going back to collect new data, or creating meaning from the raw data.

Analyzed Data is the data with which analysis is generated.


Mean:
$$
\bar{x} = \frac{\sum_i{x_i}}{n}
$$

Standard Deviation:

$$
\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_i{(x_i-\bar{x})^2}}{n-1}}
$$


Standard Error of the mean
$$
\sigma_{\bar{x}} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
$$


The 95% confidence interval is the mean plus or minus 2 standard errors of the mean. To tighten the confidence interval, either increase the sample size, control for more variables, or both.
