Example.

\begin{align\*}
y_i &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + u_i \\\\
x_i &= \gamma_0 + \gamma_1 z_i + v_i
\end{align\*}

where $x$ and $u$ are correlated, but $z$ isn't correlated with anything. $z$ is the instrumental variable.

- Variance of IV estimator

# Bias


\begin{align\*}
y &= \beta x + \eta \\\\
x &= Z\pi + \xi
\end{align\*}
