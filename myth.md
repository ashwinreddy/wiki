myth is the visionary [[literature]] of the spirit, stories of a [[symbol]]ic past, neither [[science]] nor [[metaphor]]. Some myths are etiological, serving as an [[explanation]] of some kind. These are called just-so or _pourquoi_ stories. But not all myths are like that.

Archetypal patterns in myth include the [[hero's journey]] and creation myths.  

proto-indo-european myth covers and generalizes a vast swath of mythological stories. an interesting one is _Chaoskampf_ (struggle against [[chaos]]), often involving a serpent-slaying hero.
