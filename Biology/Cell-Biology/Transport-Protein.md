A **transport protein** allows a hydrophilic substance to pass the cell membrane. **Facilitated diffusion** is when polar molecules/ions passively diffuse with the help of transport proteins.


# Channel Protein

One kind of transport protein is a channel protein, which allows the substance to pass by letting it through a channel designated specifically for it (and perhaps few other related molecules). 




# Carrier Protein

Another kind of transport protein is a carrier protein which reshapes itself around its passenger substance and passes through the membrane.

The transport proteins that move solutes against their concentration gradients are all carrier proteins rather than channel proteins. This makes sense because when channel proteins are open, they mereley allow solutes to diffuse down the concentration gradients rather than picking them up and transporting them against their gradients.
