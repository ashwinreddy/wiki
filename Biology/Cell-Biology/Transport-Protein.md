A **transport protein** allows a hydrophilic substance to pass the cell membrane. 


# Channel Protein

One kind of transport protein is a channel protein, which allows the substance to pass by letting it through a channel designated specifically for it (and perhaps few other related molecules). 




# Carrier Protein

Another kind of transport protein is a carrier protein which reshapes itself around its passenger substance and passes through the membrane.
