The **cell membrane**, also known as the **plasma membrane** is the membrane that surrounds a cell. Like all biological membranes, the cell membrane is **selectively permeable**: it allows some substances to cross more easily than others.

The **fluid mosaic model** describes the membrane as a mosaic of protein molecules bobbing in a fluid layer of phospholipids; the membrane is held together by hydrophobic interactions.

# Components

The most abundant lipids in most membranes are [phospholipids](../Macromolecules/Lipids/Phospholipids), which arrange in a bilayer.

Membrane proteins are also mostly amphipathic.

Cholesterol is wedged between phospholipid molecules in the membrane. At high temperatures, it restrains movement and lowers the temperature needed to solidify. Thus, cholesterol keeps the membrane fluid, by resisting changes, giving it the name "fluidity buffer."

The membrane must be fluid so that it is permeable and so that membrane proteins can move around. 

Functions of Membrane Proteins:

1. Transport
2. Enzymatic activity
3. Signal transduction
4. Cell-cell recognition
5. Intercellular joining
6. Attachment to the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix
