The **cell membrane**, also known as the **plasma membrane** is the membrane that surrounds a cell. Like all biological membranes, the cell membrane is selectively permeable: it allows some substances to cross more easily than others.

# Components

The most abundant lipids in most membranes are [phospholipids](../Macromolecules/Lipids/Phospholipids), which arrange in a bilayer.

Membrane proteins are also mostly amphipathic.

Cholesterol is wedged between phospholipid molecules in the membrane. At high temperatures, it restrains movement and lowers the temperature needed to solidify. Thus, cholesterol keeps the membrane fluid, by resisting changes, giving it the name "fluidity buffer."
