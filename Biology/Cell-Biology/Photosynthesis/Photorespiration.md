Photorespiration is when RuBisCO oxygenates RuBP. Adding the oxygen makes a product that it is unusable in the [[Calvin cycle]], wasting energy. Because it consumes oxygen and releases $\ce{CO2}$ and consumes ATP wastefully (ultimately meaning that it doesn't create sugars), it it thought to be an evolutionary relic.

$\ce{C4}$ plants make a 4 carbon compound with PEP Carboxylase. 

CAM plants also use PEP Carboxylase to capture $\ce{CO2}$ but only at night. They conduct their gas exchange in the cool night-time air
