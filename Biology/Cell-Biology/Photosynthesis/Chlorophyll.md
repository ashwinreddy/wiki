**Chlorophylls** are pigments that reside in the thylakoid membranes of the [[chloroplast]].

Chlorophyll A: in the [[light reaction]], it converts solar to chemical energy

Chlorophyll B: conveys energy to chlorophyll a (accessory pigment)



carotenoids: photoprotection, broaden color spectrum for photosynthesis (protect the left from UV radiation)


action spectrum
  : superposition (or maximum?) of wavelengths
