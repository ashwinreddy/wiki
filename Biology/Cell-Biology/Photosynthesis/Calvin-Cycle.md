The Calvin cycle builds three carbon sugars using light-independent reactions. The sum of all its component reactions is

\begin{equation}
\ce{3CO2} + 6 \mathrm{NADPH} + \ce{6H+} + 9 \text{ATP} \longrightarrow \text{G3P} + 6 \text{NADP}+ + 9 \text{ADP} + \ce{3H2O} + 8 \text{P}_i
\end{equation}

There are three phases in the Calvin cycle:

- Carbon Fixation. 
- Reduction. 
- Regeneration.
