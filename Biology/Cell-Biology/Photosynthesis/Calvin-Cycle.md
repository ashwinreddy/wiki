The Calvin cycle builds three carbon sugars using light-independent reactions. The sum of all its component reactions is

\begin{equation}
\ce{3CO2} + 6 \mathrm{NADPH} + \ce{6H+} + 9 \text{ATP} \longrightarrow \text{G3P} + 6 \text{NADP} + 9 \text{ADP} + \ce{3H2O} + 8 \text{P}_i
\end{equation}

From the equation, it is clear that ATP and NADPH power the cycle, which has three phases:

- Carbon Fixation. Formation of 3PG from carbon.
- Reduction. ATP and NADPH are used to convert 3PG into G3P
- Regeneration. Use G3P to make RuBP to accept $\ce{CO2}$ on the next cycle.

When $[\ce{O2}] \gg [\ce{CO2}]$, Rubisco uses $\ce{O2}$ instead of $\ce{CO2}$, making a 2 carbon molecule and releasing $\ce{CO2}$.
