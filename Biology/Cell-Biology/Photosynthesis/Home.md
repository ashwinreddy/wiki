**Photosynthesis** is how plants convert light energy to chemical energy.

1. Light-dependent or just light reactions
2. Light-independent reactions or Calvin cycle

\begin{equation}
\ce{6CO2}+\ce{6H2O} \longrightarrow \ce{C6H12O6}+\ce{6O2}
\end{equation}

Plants get water from their roots through xylem. Stomata lets CO2 in and O2 out (plants need O2 levels low). 

Chlorophyll picks up light energy. Plant cells have plastids. Chloroplast is a plastid. Chlorophyll in chloroplast.
