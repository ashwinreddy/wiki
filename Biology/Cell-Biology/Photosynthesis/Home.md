**Photosynthesis** is how plants convert light energy to chemical energy.

1. Light-dependent or just light reactions
2. Light-independent reactions or Calvin cycle

The overall reaction follows:

\begin{equation}
\ce{6CO2}+\ce{6H2O} + \text{light} \longrightarrow \ce{C6H12O6}+\ce{6O2}
\end{equation}

How do they get their inputs?

|Input|From|
|-----|-----|
|Water|Roots|
|CO2|Outside via stomata|
|Light|[[Chloroplast]]s|

Plants get water from their roots through xylem. Stomata lets CO2 in and O2 out (plants need O2 levels low).
