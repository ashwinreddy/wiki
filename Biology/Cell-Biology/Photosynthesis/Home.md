**Photosynthesis** is how plants convert light energy to chemical energy in the form of G3P sugar.

1. The light reactions use light as well as water to provide energy in the form of ATP and NADPH, producing oxygen as waste product.
2. The light-independent reactions or Calvin cycle use that energy to make G3P from $\ce{CO2}$.

The overall reaction follows:

\begin{equation}
\ce{6CO2}+\ce{6H2O} + \text{light} \longrightarrow \ce{C6H12O6}+\ce{6O2}
\end{equation}

How do they get their inputs?

|Input|From|
|-----|-----|
|Water|Roots|
|CO2|Outside via stomata|
|Light|[[Chloroplast]]s|

Plants get water from their roots through [[xylem]]. Stomata lets CO2 in and O2 out (plants need O2 levels low).
