**Aquaporin** is an integral protein that facilitates the transport of water. Although water is a small molecule, its rate of diffusion through the plasma membrane is limited by the fact that water is polar, while the interior of tte plasma membrane is largely composed of nonpolar hydrocarbon chains of fatty acids. In some cell types, such as kidney tubules and red blood cells, water movement across the membrane is much too rapid to be accounted for by simple diffusion through the lipid bilayer. For over a century, biologists had proposed that there must be a water channel in the membrane to allow for this rapid diffusion. At John Hopkins University, Peter Agre isolated a water channel protein by accident. The experimental demonstration of aquaporins led to Agre being awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2003.
