**Cellular respiration** provides the [[energy]] cells need to do work, whether chemical, mechanical, etc. It is essentially the breakdown of food. Cellular respiration includes both aerobic and anaerobic catabolic (metabolic breakdown to release energy) reactions to release energy that generates ATP, although aerobic respiration is much more efficient. It is useful to imagine aerobic respiration as analogous to combustion in an automobile. However, cells need the energy to be released in a consistent and controlled stepwise fashion to do constructive work. The general equation for cellular respiration follows:

\begin{equation}
\overbrace{\ce{C6H12O6}}^\text{sugar}+\overbrace{\ce{O2}}^\text{oxygen}\to \overbrace{\ce{CO2}}^{\text{carbon dioxide}}+\overbrace{\ce{H2O}}^{\text{water}} \qquad \Delta G < 0
\label{cellrep}
\end{equation}

In Equation $\eqref{cellrep}$, a [[redox]] reaction, the fuel (i.e. [[glucose]]) is oxidized and [[oxygen]] is reduced. In othe words, the electrons are stripped from glucose and given to carbon dioxide. Thus, the carbon dioxide produced by respiration represents fragments of oxidized organic molecules. We also note that oxygen will gain/pull electrons to become water. Some of the energy on the right hand side is used to make ATP and some is released as heat. 

The catabolic pathways involved here turn sugar, a relatively complex organic molecule, into simple products with less free energy. The difference in free energy is available to do work. 

During cellular respiration, most electrons travel down the following downhill energy route: glucose, NADH, ETC, oxygen.


There are three main stages to cellular respiration:

1. [[Glycolysis]]
2. Pyruvate Oxidation and the [[Citric Acid Cycle]]
3. [[Oxidative Phosphorylation]]

# Macromolecule Breakdown

Obviously, carbohydrates can be broken into glucose, where glycolysis will begin. Proteins are broken into amino acids and can be converted to intermediates of glycolysis and citric acid cycle but first they have to be deamination (remove amino groups). nitrogenous waste excreted by urea or waste products

Fats: glycerol to g3p in glycoslysis and beta oxidation on fatty acids to enter citric acid cycle as acetyl coa.

# Organisms

Obligate anaerobes carry out only fermentation or anaerobic respiration. Facltative anaerobes make enough ATP to survive using either fermentation or respiration.

# Ecosystem

Cellular respiration and [photosynthesis](../Photosynthesis/) together are the mechanisms for making energy in plants and animals. The energy stored in organic molecules ultimately come from the sun.
