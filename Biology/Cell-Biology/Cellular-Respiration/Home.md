**Cellular respiration** provides the [[energy]] cells need to do work, whether chemical, mechanical, etc. It is essentially the breakdown of food. Cellular respiration includes both aerobic and anaerobic catabolic (metabolic breakdown to release energy) reactions to release energy that generates ATP, although aerobic respiration is much more efficient. It is useful to imagine aerobic respiration as analogous to combustion in an automobile. The general equation for cellular respiration follows:

\begin{equation}
\overbrace{\ce{C6H12O6}}^\text{sugar}+\overbrace{\ce{O2}}^\text{oxygen}\to \overbrace{\ce{CO2}}^{\text{carbon dioxide}}+\overbrace{\ce{H2O}}^{\text{water}} \qquad \Delta G < 0
\label{cellrep}
\end{equation}

In Equation $\eqref{cellrep}$, a [[redox]] reaction, the fuel (i.e. glucose) is oxidized and oxygen is reduced. In othe words, the electrons are stripped from glucose and given to carbon dioxide. We also note that oxygen will gain/pull electrons to become water.

The catabolic pathways involved here turn sugar, a relatively complex organic molecule, into simple products with less free energy. The difference in free energy is available to do work. 

Some of the energy on the right hand side is used to make ATP and some is released as heat. 

There are three main stages to cellular respiration:

1. [[Glycolysis]]
2. Pyruvate Oxidation and the [[Citric Acid Cycle]]
3. Oxidative Phosphorylation

Cellular respiration and [photosynthesis](../Photosynthesis/) together are the mechanisms for making energy in plants and animals. The energy stored in organic molecules ultimately come from the sun.
