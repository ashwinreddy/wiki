**Cellular respiration** includes both aerobic and anaerobic catabolic reactions to release energy that generates ATP. It is useful to imagine aerobic respiration as analogous to combustion in an automobile. The general equation for cellular respiration is something like

Organic compounds $+\ce{O2}\to \ce{CO2}+\ce{H2O}+$ Energy 

Glycolysis (sugar-breaking) occurs for all organisms. It occurs whether there is oxygen or not. Glycolysis creates on net 2 ATP by taking glucose and turning it into 2 pyruvates. 

phosphofructokinase allosterically regulates ATP (feedback inhibition)
