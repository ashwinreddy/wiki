**Cellular respiration** provides the energy cells need to do work, whether chemical, mechanical, etc. Cellular respiration includes both aerobic and anaerobic catabolic reactions to release energy that generates ATP. It is useful to imagine aerobic respiration as analogous to combustion in an automobile. The general equation for cellular respiration follows:

\begin{equation}
\ce{C6H12O6}+\ce{O2}\to \ce{CO2}+\ce{H2O} \qquad \Delta G < 0
\end{equation}

The catabolic pathways involved here turn sugar, a relatively complex organic molecule, into simple products with less free energy. The difference in free energy is available to do work. 

Some of the energy on the right hand side is used to make ATP and some is released as heat. 

There are three main stages to cellular respiration:

1. [[Glycolysis]]
2. Pyruvate Oxidation and the [[Citric Acid Cycle]]
3. Oxidative Phosphorylation
