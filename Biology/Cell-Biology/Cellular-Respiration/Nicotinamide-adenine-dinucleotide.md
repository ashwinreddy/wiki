**Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide** is a coenzyme and a derivative of the vitamin niacin. It is well suited as an electron carrier because it can cycle easily between its oxidized form NAD+ and its reduced form NADH. As an electron acceptor, NAD+ functions as an oxidizing agent during [cellular respiration](./).

Electrons lose very little of their potential energy when they are transferred from glucose to NAD+. Each NADH molecule formed during respiration represents stored energy, which can be tapped to make ATP when the electrosn complete their "fall" in a series of steps down an energy gradient from NADH to oxygen.
