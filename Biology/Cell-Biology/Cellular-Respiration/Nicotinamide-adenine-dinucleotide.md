**Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide** is a coenzyme and a derivative of the vitamin niacin. It is well suited as an electron carrier because it can cycle easily between its oxidized form NAD+ and its reduced form NADH. As an electron acceptor, NAD+ functions as an oxidizing agent during [[cellular respiration]].
