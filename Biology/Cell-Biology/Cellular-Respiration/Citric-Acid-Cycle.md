# Pyruvate Oxidation

Sometimes called a link reaction

In the [[mitochondria]]l matrix, pyruvate enters (via a transport protein). Make more NADH, $\ce{CO2}$

# Citric Acid Cycle

\begin{equation}
\text{Acetyl CoA} \to \text{Citrate} + \ce{CO2}
\end{equation}

Net gain: 2 ATP, 6 NADH, 2 FADH2

NADH more energized than FADH2
