In the **citric acid cycle**, acetyl CoA drives the generation of NADH of FADH2 and ATP.

1. Acetyl CoA combines with a four carbon acceptor oxaloacetate to form six-carbon citrate
2. Citrate is converted into isocitrate, an isomer, by removing one water and adding another
3. Isocitrate is oxidized, reducing NAD+ to NADH. A CO2 is released
4. Another carbon on isocitrate is released to make CO2 and generate NADH
5.

\begin{equation}
\text{Acetyl CoA} \to \text{Citrate} + \ce{CO2}
\end{equation}

Net gain: 2 ATP, 6 NADH, 2 FADH2

NADH more energized than FADH2

ATP produced by substrate-level phosphorylation

Acetyl CoA is just a shuttle. It drops a CoA
