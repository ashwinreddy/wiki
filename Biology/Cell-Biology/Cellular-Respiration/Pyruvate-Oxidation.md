In **pyruvate oxidation** (aka link reaction), the pyruvate products from [[glycolysis]] are oxidated to Acetyl CoA before the [[citric acid cycle]] can occur. Pyruvate oxidation occurs in the [[mitochondria]]l matrix when $\ce{O2}$ is present.

Because pyruvate is a charged molcule, the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells have a transport protein to help in actively transporting it. 

 Make more NADH, $\ce{CO2}$
