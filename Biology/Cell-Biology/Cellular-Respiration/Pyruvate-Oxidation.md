In **pyruvate oxidation** (aka link reaction), the pyruvate products from [[glycolysis]] are oxidated to Acetyl CoA before the [[citric acid cycle]] can occur. Pyruvate oxidation occurs in the [[mitochondria]]l matrix when $\ce{O2}$ is present.

Firstly, pyruvate enters the mitochondrion of eukaryotic cells via a transport protein because pyruvate is a charged molecule. 

What exactly goes into and comes out pyruvate oxidation? A complex of several enzymes (pyruvate dehydrogenase complex) catalyzes these steps:
1. One of the carbons on the three carbon chain of pyruvate bonds with an oxygen and leaves the cell as $\ce{CO2}$ by diffusion.
2. An NAD+ picks up hydrogen to make NADH
3. What's left is Acetyl CoA

So far, including glycolysis products, we have:

- 4 NADH
- Acetyl CoA

and we made 2 ATP already for the cell to use

Acetyl CoA has a high potential energy, which is used to transfer the acetyl group to a molecule in the citric acid cycle, a reaction that is therefore highly exergonic.

The next step is the [[citric acid cycle]].
