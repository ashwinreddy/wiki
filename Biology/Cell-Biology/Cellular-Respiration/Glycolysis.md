**Glycolysis** (sugar-breaking), which occurs in the cytosol, breaks [[glucose]] into pyruvate. Glycolysis occurs for all organisms whether there is $\ce{O2}$ is present or not (i.e. aerobic process). We can separate glycolysis into two phases:

1. Energy investment. In this phase, the cell spends 2 ATP per glucose.
2. Energy payoff

# Energy payoff

The energy invested is used to regenerate ATPs from ADP in substrate-level phosphorylation. Additionally, 2 NAD+ molecules are reduced through the oxidation of glucose.

# Net Results

Each glucose is separated into 2 pyruvates and 2 water molecules. 4 ATPs are formed, but 2 ATPs were needed during the investment phase. 2 ATPs on net are generated. Finally, 2 NADH molecules and 2 H+ were created.

# Efficiency

Glycolysis releases less than 25% of the chemical energy in glucose that can be harvested by cells; most of the energy remains stockpiled in the two molecules of pyruvate.

Phosphofructokinase is a kinase enzyme that phosphorylates fructose 6-phosphate in glycolysis.
