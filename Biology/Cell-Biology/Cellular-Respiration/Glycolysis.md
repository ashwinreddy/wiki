**Glycolysis** (sugar-breaking), which occurs in the cytosol, breaks [[glucose]] into pyruvate. Glycolysis occurs for all organisms whether there is $\ce{O2}$ is present or not (i.e. aerobic process). We can separate glycolysis into two phases (we will look at what happens per 1 glucose molecule):

1. Energy investment. 2 ATP are spent.
2. Energy payoff. 4 ATP are regenerated and 2 NAD+ reduced, creating 2 pyruvate and $\ce{2H2O}$.

To summarize,
\begin{align}
\text{Glucose} \to 2\,\text{Pyruvate} + \ce{2H2O} + 2\,\text{ATP}+2\,\text{NADH} + 2\,\ce{H+} \\\
\end{align}

Glycolysis releases less than 25% of the chemical energy in glucose that can be harvested by cells; most of the energy remains stockpiled in the two molecules of pyruvate.

The next step, if $\ce{O2}$ is present, is [[pyruvate oxidation]].

Phosphofructokinase is a kinase enzyme that phosphorylates fructose 6-phosphate in glycolysis.
