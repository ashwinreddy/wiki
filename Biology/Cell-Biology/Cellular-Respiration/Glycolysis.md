**Glycolysis** (sugar-breaking), which occurs in the cytosol, breaks glucose into pyruvate. We can separate glycolysis into two phases:

1. Energy investment. In this phase, the cell spends ATP.
2. Energy payoff

# Energy payoff

The energy invested is used to regenerate ATPs from ADP in substrate-level phosphorylation. Additionally, 


Glycolysis (sugar-breaking) occurs for all organisms. It occurs whether there is oxygen or not. Glycolysis creates on net 2 ATP by taking glucose and turning it into 2 pyruvates. 

Makes 2 pyruvate, 2 ATP, 2 NADH

is anaerobic

Anaerobic respiration:

Yeast, for example, takes pyruvate and turns into acetalaldehyde.
