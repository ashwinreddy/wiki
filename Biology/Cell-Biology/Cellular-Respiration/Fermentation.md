**Fermentation** is the partial degradation of sugars or other organic fuel that occurs without the use of oxygen. In alcohol fermentation, pyruvate is converted to ethanol in two steps. During lactic acid fermentation, pyruvate is reduced directly by NADH to form lactate, regenerating NAD+ with no release of $\ce{CO2}$.

Organisms that use fermentation do so because they don't have an ETC, but they still need way to regenerate NAD+. They can do this with pyruvate or one of its derivatives. Basically, we need an oxidizing agent. 

In alcohol fermentation, pyruvate is decomposed into acetaldehyde, which acts as an electron acceptor. Then it can give its electrons to NADH (i.e. oxidize it) to turn it back into NAD+. Alcohol is a waste product, but humans use it for food and stuff.

In lactic acid fermentation, pyruvate is the electron acceptor and lactate is made instead.
