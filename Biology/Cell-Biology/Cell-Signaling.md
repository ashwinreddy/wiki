Animal cells communicate by:

- direct contact (e.g. gap junction), talk to one other cell, connected cytoplasm
- secreting local regulators, growth factors, neuro transmitters
- long distance (hormones, target receptors)

# Relay

activated relay molecule makes inactive protein kinase active. Protein kinase phosphorylates another protein kinase. 

Calcium and cyclic AMP can be a second messenger

Second Messenger
  : Small nonprotein molecules/ions that can relay signal inside cell.

# Transduction

Cascades of molecular interactions relay signals from receptors

Protein kinase is an enzyme that phosphorylates and activates proteins at next level

Phosphorylation cascades enhance and amplify signal.
