**Bacteria** are special prokaryotic unicellular organisms. In bacteria, most genes are carried on a single chromosome that consists of circular DNA molecules and associated proteins.

Binary [[fission]] begins when the DNA replicates at the origin of replication. One copy moves to an end of the cell. Then, each copy is at an end of the cell while the cell elongates. A new cell wall is formed.
