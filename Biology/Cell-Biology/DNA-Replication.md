[[DNA]] replicates via the semi-conservative model. 

# Replication Models

|Model|Replication pattern|
|-----|--------------------|
|Conservative model|The entire double helix is copied|
|Semiconservative|The new DNA has some original and some duplicated material|
|Dispersive|Segments of DNA are broken up, resulting in mixed original/duplicate components|

## Meselson-Stahl

Grow bacteria with heavy nitrogen in DNA and then move it to light nitrogen. Centrifuge it.

# Replication

1. Find origin(s) of replication (bacteria have single origin, but eukaryotes often have many)
2. Replicate in both directions.
3. Helicase unwinds and separates parental DNA.
4. Single-stranded binding proteins stabilize open strands.
5. Topoisomerase relieves downstream DNA from stress by breaking, rejoining, swiveling DNA pieces
6. Primase synthesizes RNA primers.
7. DNA polymerase I removes & replaces RNA primer with DNA.
8. DNA polymerase III adds nucleotides in 5' to 3' direction.

However, since DNA polymerase III can only build one way, only one strand can be built continuously while the other has to be built in fragments. The strand built continuously is the leading strand. The other is the lagging strand.

On the lagging strand, the fragments are called Okazaki fragments. They require ligase and polymerase I to keep replacing RNA.

DNA molecules have uneven ends due to this 5' to 3' nature, ends which are also shortening. Telomeres, genetic material serving as caps at the end of DNA do the following:

- prevent these uneven ends as being read as errors
- protect the genes from being modified directly





Nucleotides are phosphorylated.
