DNA replicates via the semi-conservative model. 

# Replication Models

|Model|Replication pattern|
|-----|--------------------|
|Conservative model|The entire double helix is copied|
|Semiconservative|The new DNA has some original and some duplicated material|
|Dispersive|Segments of DNA are broken up, resulting in mixed original/duplicate components|
