A **chromosome** is a unit of genetic information. When the chromosome duplicates in [[mitosis]], it takes on a new shape, but it is still called a chromosome. Therefore, a chromosome can either be depicted as a single thin cylinder shape or as an X-shape. When in the X-shape, the location where the sister chromatids cross is called the centromere (the [[kinetochore]] will attach here). The operational way to determine the number of chromosomes in a picture is to count the number of separate DNA molecules.


Chromosomes are visible only once they have condensed.
