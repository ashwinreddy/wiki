A **chromosome** is a unit of genetic information. When the chromosome duplicates in [[mitosis]], it takes on a new shape, but it is still called a chromosome. Therefore, a chromosome can either be depicted as a single thin cylinder shape or as an X-shape. Identifying the number of chromosomes is equal to identifying the number of DNA molecules.

Chromosomes are visible only once they have condensed.
