1. Find origin(s) of replication (bacteria have single origin, but eukaryotes often have many)
2. Replicate in both directions.
3. Helicase unwinds and separates parental DNA.
4. Single-stranded binding proteins stabilize open strands.
5. Topoisomerase relieves downstream DNA from stress by breaking, rejoining, swiveling DNA pieces
6. Primase synthesizes RNA primers.
7. DNA polymerase I removes & replaces RNA primer with DNA.
8. DNA polymerase III adds nucleotides in 5' to 3' direction.

However, since DNA polymerase III can only build one way, only one strand can be built continuously while the other has to be built in fragments. The strand built continuously is the leading strand. The other is the lagging strand.

On the lagging strand, the fragments are called Okazaki fragments. They require ligase and polymerase I to keep replacing RNA.

DNA molecules have uneven ends due to this 5' to 3' nature, ends which are also shortening. Telomeres, genetic material serving as caps at the end of DNA do the following:

- prevent these uneven ends as being read as errors
- protect the genes from being modified directly

Nucleotides are phosphorylated to give polymerase energy needed to add the nucleotides in.

# Proofreading and Repair

- Repair enzymes remove and replace incorrectly paired nucleotides that result from replication errors
- Nuclease cuts segments of DNA strands containing damage
- DNA polymerase proofreads nucleotides and repeats if incorrect
- Ligase seals free end of new DNA to old DNA, making the strand complete.
