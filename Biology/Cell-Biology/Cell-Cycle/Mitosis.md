**Mitosis** is the part of the [cell cycle](./) in which the genetic material in the nucleus divides, usually followed by cytokinesis, division of the cytoplasm.

|Stage|Events|
|-----|------|
|Prophase|Chromosomes condense, Mitotic spindle begins to form, nuclear envelope disappears|
|Prometaphase|Chromosomes finish condensing, nuclear envelope breaks down, mitotic spindle grows more, microtubules start capturing chromosomes|
|Metaphase|Chromosomes lined up on the metaphase plate, kinetochores of each chromosome attached to microtubules from opposite spindle poles|
|Anaphase|Mitotic spindle pulls sister chromatids apart, kinetochore microtubules pull chromosomes toward poles|
|Telophase|Chromosomes begin decondensing, spindle disappears, nuclear membrane reforms, nucleolus reappears|
