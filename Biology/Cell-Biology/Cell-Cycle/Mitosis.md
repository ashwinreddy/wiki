**Mitosis** is the part of the [cell cycle](./) in which the genetic material in the nucleus divides, usually followed by cytokinesis, division of the cytoplasm. For all of mitosis except telophase, there is twice as much genetic material in the cell as there is during G1, since the DNA was duplicated in the S phase of interphase. Most cells divide something like 40 times in their lifetime.

|Stage|Events|
|-----|------|
|Prophase|Chromosomes condense, Mitotic spindle begins to form, nuclear envelope disappears|
|Prometaphase|Chromosomes finish condensing, nuclear envelope breaks down, mitotic spindle grows more, microtubules start capturing chromosomes|
|Metaphase|Chromosomes lined up on the metaphase plate, kinetochores of each chromosome attached to microtubules from opposite spindle poles|
|Anaphase|Mitotic spindle pulls sister chromatids apart, kinetochore microtubules pull chromosomes toward poles|
|Telophase|Chromosomes begin decondensing, spindle disappears, nuclear membrane reforms, nucleolus reappears|
