The **mitotic spindle** is a structure of eukaryotic cells that forms during cell divison to separate sister chromatids between daughter cells. It is composed of the [[centrosome]]s and their extending microtubules. The short radial microtubules coming out of the centrosomes are collectively called asters (because they look like stars).








It begins to form in the cytoplasm during prophase. It consists of fibers made of [[microtubule]]s and proteins. Other microtubules of the cytoskeleton partially dissemble to provide the materials for the mitotic spindle.
