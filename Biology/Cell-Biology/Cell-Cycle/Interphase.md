**Interphase** is the part of the [cell cycle](./) in which the cell spends most of its life.


|Phase in Interphase|Event|
|:-----:|-----|
|G1|Cellular contents except chromosomes duplicated|
|S|Chromosomes double, but they are not yet visible because they have not condensed|
|G2|Cell ensures duplication occured correctly. Synthesis of microtubules|


In G2, the nuclear envelope still encloses the nucleus. Two centrosomes are around (recall G1 phase)
