The **cell cycle** is the life of a cell from formation to death. When the cell is operating normally, producing proteins and such, it is in interphase:

|Phase in Interphase|Event|
|:-----:|-----|
|G1|Cellular contents except chromosomes duplicated|
|S|Chromosomes double, but they are not yet visible because they have not condensed|
|G2|Cell ensures duplication occured correctly. Synthesis of microtubules|

In G2, the nuclear envelope still encloses the nucleus. Two centrosomes are around (recall G1 phase)

There are internal and external cues for cell division. THe internal cues come from molecules called kinases. Cdk, or cyclin-dependent kinase, is the main one for cell division. Cyclin is broken down and rebuilt; its levels change. It accumulates as cell nears G2. Cdk levels are constant, but it is only active when it binds to cyclin. 

MPF (maturation promoting factor) is CDK to cyclin (activated enzyme). Therefore, the slope of MPF levels matches cyclin levels.

[[Kinetochore]]s provide internal cues that signal M-phase. M-phase takes place in mitosis, between metaphase and anaphase.

Kinetochores not attached to spindles trigger a signaling pathway that keeps APC (anaphase-promoting complex, example of a kinase) in an inactive state.

External factors include

- growth factors (released by other cells), paracrine communication
- density independent inhibition
- anchorage dependence (must be attached to another cell or ECM)

Division requires cells to have certain kinds of nutrients. 

Platelets originate from red blood cells, help in clotting. Platelet derived growth factor

Cancer cells make their own growth factor (autocrine) they force neighbors to make growth factors for them. or they might grow w/o a growth factor. cancer cell sthat stop dividing stop at random points in the cycle.

In G2, the nuclear envelope encloses the nucleus. The chromosomes, which have duplicated during the S phase, have not yet condensed. It is ready to begin [[mitosis]]. After the cell has duplicated, the daughter cells will go back to interphase and the cycle repeats.

Most cells divide something like 40 times in their lifetime.
