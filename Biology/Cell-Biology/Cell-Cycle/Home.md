The **cell cycle** is the life of a cell from formation to death. When the cell is operating normally, producing proteins and such, it is in [[interphase]]. Then, [[mitosis]] might occur. 


In G2, the nuclear envelope encloses the nucleus. The chromosomes, which have duplicated during the S phase, have not yet condensed. It is ready to begin [[mitosis]]. After the cell has duplicated, the daughter cells will go back to interphase and the cycle repeats.

# Cell Cycle Control System

There are checkpoints, control points where stop and go-ahead signals regulate the cycle. Three important checkpoints are found in G1, G2, and M phases.

There are internal and external cues for cell division. 

## Internal Factors

The internal cues come from [[kinase]]s, Cdks in particular. 

- Cyclin synthesis begins in late S phase and accumulates
- Cyclin binds to Cdk to produce a complex known as MPF (maturation-promoting factor). 
- Enough MPF accumulates; the cell passes G2 checkpoint and begins mitosis. 
- MPF promotes mitosis by phosphorylating various proteins. MPF's activity peaks during metaphase. 
- During anaphase, the cyclin in MPF is degraded, terminating the M phase. 
- The cell enters G1 phase, in which degradation of cyclin continues, and the Cdk of MPF is recycled.

Note that Cdk levels are constant, but it is only active when it binds to cyclin.Therefore, the slope of MPF levels matches cyclin levels.

The G1 phase (aka "restriction point") is super important. For many cells, if a cell gets the go-ahead at G1, it'll usually complete G1, S, G2, M, and divide. If it doesn't recieve the go-ahead, it may exit the cycle and switch to a nondividing G0 phase. Most of your cells are in G0 phase.


[[Kinetochore]]s provide internal cues that signal M-phase. M-phase takes place in mitosis, between metaphase and anaphase.

Kinetochores not attached to spindles trigger a signaling pathway that keeps APC (anaphase-promoting complex, example of a kinase) in an inactive state.

## External Factors

External factors include

- growth factors (released by other cells), paracrine communication
- density independent inhibition
- anchorage dependence (must be attached to another cell or ECM)

Division requires cells to have certain kinds of nutrients. 

Platelets originate from red blood cells, help in clotting. Platelet derived growth factor

## Cancer

Cancer cells make their own growth factor (autocrine), and/or they force neighbors to make growth factors for them. or they might grow w/o a growth factor. Cancer cells that stop dividing stop at random points in the cycle.
