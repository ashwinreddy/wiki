The **cell cycle** is the life of a cell from formation to death. When the cell is operating normally, producing proteins and such, it is in interphase. In interphase, the genetic material in the cell is duplicated so that the cell can divide and each daughter cell will have the appropriate amount of genetic material (or, more accurately, the correct number of chromosomes). The synthesis of this new DNA is designated as the S (S for synthesis) phase, and the phases of general growth that come before and after are designated G1 and G2 (G for gap).

There are internal and external cues for cell division. THe internal cues come from molecules called kinases.

In G2, the nuclear envelope encloses the nucleus. The chromosomes, which have duplicated during the S phase, have not yet condensed. It is ready to begin [[mitosis]]. After the cell has duplicated, the daughter cells will go back to interphase and the cycle repeats.

Most cells divide something like 40 times in their lifetime.
