**Gene expression** is the process by which DNA directs the synthesis of proteins. The one gene - one enzyme hypothesis by Archibald Garrod said that each gene encodes one enzyme. Beadle & Tatum proved this with the following clever experiment:

- Create genetic mutants of a bread spore. They can all thrive in conducive control environments.
- Test their growth with limited environments.
- Conclude that each gene encodes an enzyme and mutants missing genes have an incomplete pathway.

The current hypothesis is the one gene - one polypeptide hypothesis, but there are exceptions. The model we have is based on the supposition of the central dogma:

[[Transcription]]
[[Translation]]

-------------

A gene is expressed if it is transcribed and translated. 

How do bacteria regulate gene expression? First, transcription can be regulated. The gene does not have to be transcribed if the environment is not forcing it to produce the gene. There can also be levels of expression.

In multicellular eukaryotes, gene expression determines and configures cells to being their specialized selves. Every cell has the same genetic information, so what distinguishes an eye cell from a liver cell is which genes are being turned on.

Bacteria can rapidly respond to changes in the environment with gene regulation -- they only make those proteins which they have to make. They do this in two ways:

- [[feedback inhibition]]
- operon model
