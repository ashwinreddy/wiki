**Gene expression** is the process by which DNA directs the synthesis of proteins. The one gene - one enzyme hypothesis by Archibald Garrod said that each gene encodes one enzyme. Beadle & Tatum proved this with the following clever experiment:

- Create genetic mutants of a bread spore. They can all thrive in conducive control environments.
- Test their growth with limited environments.
- Conclude that each gene encodes an enzyme and mutants missing genes have an incomplete pathway.

The current hypothesis is the one gene - one polypeptide hypothesis, but there are exceptions.
