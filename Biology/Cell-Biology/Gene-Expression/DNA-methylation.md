**DNA methylation** is the process of adding methyl groups to DNA. It leads to reduced transcription in some species and long-term inactivation in cellular differentiation. Methylation explains Barr bodies and X-inactivation. 

Methylation patterns are passed to daughter cells and embryos remember what was silenced. This is called genomic imprinting / epigenetic inheritance.
