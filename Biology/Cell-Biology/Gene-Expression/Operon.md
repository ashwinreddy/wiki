**Operons** are units of DNA that consist of a promoter, operator, and then a group of related genes. Here is a diagram:

The regulatory gene lives upstream from the operon and has its own promoter. The regulatory gene encodes for a repressor protein. It is expressed continuously, so there are always a few repressor molecules floating around in the cells.
