**Operons** are units of DNA that consist of a promoter, operator (on/off switch), and then a group of related genes. Here is a diagram:

The regulatory gene lives upstream from the operon and has its own promoter. The regulatory gene encodes for a repressor protein. It is expressed continuously, so there are always a few repressor molecules floating around in the cells.

These repressor molecules can bind to the operator under certain conditions, preventing RNA polymerase from creating a transcript out of the operon genes.

|Repressible|Inducible|
|-----------|---------|
|An operon which is usually on but can be repressed (inhibited)|An operon which is usually off but can be induced (turned on)|
|Typically associated with anabolic activity.|Typically associated with catabolic activity.|

For a repressible operon, the repressor molecules are usually inactive, but when they bind to the corepressor (e.g. tryptophan), they become active and prevent RNA polymerase from proceeding.
