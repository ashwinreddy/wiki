**Operons** are units of DNA that consist of a promoter, operator (on/off switch), and then a group of related genes. Here is a diagram:

The regulatory gene lives upstream from the operon and has its own promoter. The regulatory gene encodes for a repressor protein. It is expressed continuously, so there are always a few repressor molecules floating around in the cells.

These repressor molecules can bind to the operator under certain conditions, preventing RNA polymerase from creating a transcript out of the operon genes.

|Repressible|Inducible|
|-----------|---------|
|An operon which is usually on but can be repressed (inhibited)|An operon which is usually off but can be induced (turned on)|
|Typically associated with anabolic activity.|Typically associated with catabolic activity.|
|Repressor molecules become active and bind to operator when corepressor is around|Repressor molecules become inactive when corepressor is around|
|Bacteria usually produce their own tryptophan, unless there is tryptophan around|Bacteria usually don't produce lactose, unless there is lactose around|

The repressible/inducible model describes negative gene regulation because it is creating repressors.
