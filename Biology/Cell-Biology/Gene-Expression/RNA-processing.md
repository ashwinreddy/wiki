These help in exporting the mRNA from the nucleus.

# Splicing

In eukaryotes, not all of the DNA encodes genetic material. The introns are non-coding sequences, and the exons are the coding sequences. Spliceosomes cut introns out using ribozymes, which are RNA molecules acting as enzymes. They can do this because

1. They are single-stranded
2. They have functional groups in RNA bases
3. They can hydrogen bond

Spliceosomes have small RNAs that match introns, delete them, and then paste the exons.
