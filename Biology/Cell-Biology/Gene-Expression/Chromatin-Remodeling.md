To make it easier to access DNA, loosen the DNA from the histones using histone acetylation. To make it harder, tighten the DNA using [[DNA methylation]].

|Object|Analogue|Charge|
|-----|----------|-----|
|DNA|Thread|[[DNA]] is negatively charged|
|Histones|Wooden Spool|Histones are positively charged|
|Acetylate|Loosen|Acetyl is negatively charged|
|Methylate|Tighten|Methyl groups are neutral|

To loosen methylated chromatin, phosphorylate (i.e. add phosphate groups) next to a methylated amino acid.

Changes to the chromatin can be reversed.
