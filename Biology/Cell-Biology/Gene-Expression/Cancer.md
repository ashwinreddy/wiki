Proto-oncogenes stimulate cell division. Tumor-Suppressor genes inhibit cells division; its proteins repair damaged DNA, control cell adhesion, and inhibit cell-cycle via cell signaling. Mutations in either of these may lead to cancer.

A mutation in the proto-oncogene leads to an Onco gene (cancer-causing), which increases products that the porto-oncogene was making and/or activity of each protein molecule produced by the porto-oncogene. 

You need a couple mutations to accumulate before cancer. The longer you live, the higher the likelihood. 1.5% of DNA in human genome codes for proteins or functional RNA.

How a proto-oncogne turns into an oncogene?

1. Gene moves to a new location and now under new control elements (translocation / transposition)
2. Multiple copies of the genes are made
3. Point mutation in the control element or gene.
