A gene is expressed if it is transcribed and translated. 

How do bacteria regulate gene expression? First, transcription can be regulated. The gene does not have to be transcribed if the environment is not forcing it to produce the gene. There can also be levels of expression.

In multicellular eukaryotes, gene expression determines and configures cells to being their specialized selves. Every cell has the same genetic information, so what distinguishes an eye cell from a liver cell is which genes are being turned on.

Bacteria can rapidly respond to changes in the environment with gene regulation -- they only make those proteins which they have to make. They do this in two ways:

- [[feedback inhibition]]
- operon model
