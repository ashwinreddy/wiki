How do bacteria regulate [gene expression](./)? First, they can regulate [[transcription]]. Take the example of tryptophan. When enough tryptophan is produced for the cell, the cell stops producing the enzyme that helps create it.





First, they can regulate transcription. The gene does not have to be transcribed if the environment is not forcing it to produce the gene. There can also be levels of expression.

In multicellular eukaryotes, gene expression determines and configures cells to being their specialized selves. Every cell has the same genetic information, so what distinguishes an eye cell from a liver cell is which genes are being turned on.

Bacteria can rapidly respond to changes in the environment with gene regulation -- they only make those proteins which they have to make. They do this in two ways:

- [[feedback inhibition]]
- operon model
