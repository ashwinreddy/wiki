Prokaryotes and eukaryotes both regulate their gene expression. For eukaryotes, it is also how they differentiate into cell types.

Gene Regulation
: Mechanisms that induce or repress the expression of a gene

Bacteria can rapidly respond to changes in the environment with gene regulation -- they only make those proteins which they have to make. So how do bacteria regulate [gene expression](./)? First, they can regulate [[transcription]]. Take the example of tryptophan. When enough tryptophan is produced for the cell, the cell stops producing the enzymes that helps create it. They can also regulate the activity of one of the enzymes that helped create it through [[feedback inhibition]], which results in a much quicker response.

The cell can very effectively stop producing the enzymes that create tryptophan because all the enzymes in the pathway are grouped together in the DNA. Thus, the polypeptide sequences can be put into one mRNA, punctuated with start and stop codons. What controls whether the group of genes will be transcribed or not is the operator, which can be thought of as a switch. The operator sits within the promoter or between the promoter and the enzyme-coding genes.

The operator, promoter, and genes are together called the operon. An operon like _trp_ is called a repressible operon because it is usually on but can be silenced. By default, the operon can be transcribed because RNA polymerase can bind to the promoter and transcribe the operon's genes. Repression of the gene occurs with a repressor protein. Repressor proteins bind to the promoter, preventing RNA polymerase from transcribing. The repressor is specific to the operator for that operon.

The repressor is created as a protein product of another gene, a regulatory gene which is some distance away from the operon and has its own promoter. These are expressed continuously, so there are always a few repressor molecules. The represssor only binds to the promorer when it binds to its target, which is called the corepressor.

On the other hand, an inducible operon is typically off but is induced to be turned on when a molecule interacts with a regulatory protein. The classic example is the _lac_ operon. The repressor is active by default, preventing the cell from making lactase. But when allolactose comes along, it changes the shape of the repressor, which detaches from the operator, making it possible for RNA polymerase to start transcription. The enzymes of the lactose pathway are called inducible enyzmes.

Repressible typically goes with anabolic, and inducible typically goes with catabolic.

Because the gene is not produced when the repressor protein is active, the regulation is called negative control. Positive control would mean directly turning transcription on.

# Negative Gene Regulation

# Positive Gene Regulation

_E. coli_ only breaks down lactose if glucose is in short supply. This means _E. coli_ must sense the glucose concentration and relay this information to the _lac_ operon. When glucose is scarce, cyclic AMP accumulates. So somehow a high amount of cyclic AMP needs to be associated with an increase in affinity for _lac_. The association comes in the form of an activator, a type of regulatory protein, known as CAP.




In multicellular eukaryotes, gene expression determines and configures cells to being their specialized selves. Every cell has the same genetic information, so what distinguishes an eye cell from a liver cell is which genes are being turned on.
