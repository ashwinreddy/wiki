Prokaryotes and eukaryotes both regulate their gene expression. For eukaryotes, it is also how they differentiate into cell types.

Gene Regulation
: Mechanisms that induce or repress the expression of a gene

Bacteria can rapidly respond to changes in the environment with gene regulation -- they only make those proteins which they have to make. So how do bacteria regulate [gene expression](./)? First, they can regulate [[transcription]]. Take the example of tryptophan. When enough tryptophan is produced for the cell, the cell stops producing the enzymes that helps create it. They can also regulate the activity of one of the enzymes that helped create it through [[feedback inhibition]], which results in a much quicker response.

The bacteria can very effectively stop producing the enzymes that create tryptophan because all the enzymes in the pathway are grouped together in the DNA in what is called an [[operon]]. Thus, the polypeptide sequences can be put into one mRNA, punctuated with start and stop codons. What controls whether the group of genes will be transcribed or not is the operator, which can be thought of as a switch. The operator sits within the promoter or between the promoter and the enzyme-coding genes.

The operator, promoter, and genes are together called the operon. An operon like _trp_ is called a repressible operon because it is usually on but can be silenced. By default, the operon can be transcribed because RNA polymerase can bind to the promoter and transcribe the operon's genes. Repression of the gene occurs with a repressor protein. Repressor proteins bind to the promoter, preventing RNA polymerase from transcribing. The repressor is specific to the operator for that operon.

The repressor is created as a protein product of another gene, a regulatory gene which is some distance away from the operon and has its own promoter. These are expressed continuously, so there are always a few repressor molecules. The represssor only binds to the promorer when it binds to its target, which is called the corepressor.

Because the gene is not produced when the repressor protein is active, the regulation is called negative control. Positive control would mean directly turning transcription on.

# Positive Gene Regulation

_E. coli_ preferentially breaks down glucose instead of lactose. It only breaks down lactose if glucose is in short supply. How does the cell know when glucose is in short supply and how does that signal trigger lactase to be made?

When glcuose is in short supply, cyclic AMP (cAMP) accumulates. An activator binds to the DNA and stimulates transcription by increasing the affinity of RNA polymerase to that gene's promoter. The activator in this example is called cAMP receptor protein (CRP). 

When glucose levels increase, CRP detaches. CAP also helps regulate other operins in catabolic pathways, too.

# Eukaryotic Regulation of Gene Expression

The typical human cells only expresses 20% of genes expressed at any given time. The difference between cell types is due to **differential gene expression**.

Eukaryotes have more ways of regulating their genes.

First, eukaryotes can control access to the DNA through [[chromatin remodeling]]. Next, they can control transcription initiation. Even if the gene is available for transcription, the DNA can be made more or less accessible to the _transcription machinery_.
