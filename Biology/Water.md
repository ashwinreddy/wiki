**Water** is the molecule $\ce{H2O}$.

# Properties

The properties of water are incredibly important because they shape the evolution of life. Many of the properties of water stem from the fact that it is a [polar](../Chemistry/Polarity#polar-molecule) molecule as well as [hydrogen-bonding](../Chemistry/Intermolecular-Forces#hydrogen-bonding)


- Adhesion, water molecules form hydrogen bonds with each other
- Cohesion, water molecules form hydrogen bonds with polar surfaces
- Liquid at body temperature
- High heat of vaporization
- High specific heat capacity
- Greatest density occurs at $4^\deg \mathrm{C}$

The pH of water is 7, which makes it amphoteric (both acid and base).

Other compounds can be hydrophilic (water-loving) or hydrophobic (water-fearing). A compound is likely to be hydrophilic with the presence of polar bonds, which allow for hydrogen bonding.
