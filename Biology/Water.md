# Properties

The properties of water are incredibly important because they shape the evolution of life. Many of the properties of water stem from the fact that it is a [polar](../Chemistry/Polarity#polar-molecule) molecule.


- Adhesion
- Cohesion
- High specific heat capacity

The pH of water is 7, which makes it amphoteric (both acid and base).
