The allele and genotype frequencies of a population will remain constant from generation to generation. Unless acted upon by forces other than Mendelian segregation and recombination of alleles. In equilibrium, the frequencies are constant.

Assumptions:

1. No mutations
2. Random mating
3. No natural selection
4. Extremely large population size
5. No gene flow

If any of these assumptions is false, the population is evolving.

\begin{equation}
p+q=1
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
p^2 + 2pq+q^2 = 1
\end{equation}
