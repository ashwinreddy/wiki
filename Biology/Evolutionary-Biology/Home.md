[[Natural selection]] acts on individuals. Populations evolve.

[[Microevolution]] is a change in allele frequencies in a population over generations.

Mutation and sexual reproduction create variation in the gene pool. 

Variation could be geographic, for example a cline in which the trait changes along a geographic axis.

Sources of genetic variation:

1. Point mutations
2. Chromosomal mutations
3. Sexual recombination (crossing over, independent assortment of chromosomes, random fertilization)
