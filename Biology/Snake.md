**Snakes** are carnivorous reptiles.

> Snakes are indeed remarkably good at keeping themselves hidden from view. They are nearly impossible for mammals, including primates with their excellent vision, to see from a distance. Fortunately this is not a terrible problem for their prey because snakes are dangerous only when they are within fairly close range. On the other hand, snakes can be highly cryptic even up close. The ability of many snakes to blend into the background depends on both their coloration and the disruption to their patterns of color as they lie coiled upon themselves. Snakes often have color patterns that camouflage themselves very well against the background substrate. [@isbell2009fruit]
