Ethanol fermentation is the anaerobic biological process of decomposing sugar into alcohol and carbon dioxide. For alcohol, the yeast _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_ is used. Fermentation can produce other flavorful molecules as well.

\begin{equation}
\ce{C6H12O6} \to 2\ce{C2H6O} + 2\ce{CO2}
\end{equation}

Straight fermentation will not result in a solution more than 15-20% ABV.
