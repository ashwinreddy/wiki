**Nucleotides** consist of a phosphate connected to a sugar connected to a nitrogenous base. A diagram is given below:

Linked nucleotides therefore form a **sugar phosphate backbone**. The bond that links them is called a **phosphodiester bond**. 

\begin{equation}
\overbrace{\text{phospho}}^{\text{phosphate group}}\underbrace{\text{di}}_{\text{double-sided}}\text{ester}
\end{equation}

Adenine, Thymine, Guanine, Cytosine. The purines include A and G.



| Purine | Pyrimidine |
