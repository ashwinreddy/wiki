**microRNA** (abbreviated **miRNA**) are formed from large non-coding RNA precursors. At least 1/2 of all genes might be regulated by miRNA.

It is stored in hairpin loops. A dicer cuts some off at the bend and if it totally binds to RNA, the RNA degrades.If it only partially binds, translation is blocked.
