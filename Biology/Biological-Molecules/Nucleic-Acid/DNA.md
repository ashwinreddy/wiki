**DNA** is a macromolecule that is used to store genetic information. It consists of two sugar-phosphate backbones intertwined in a double helix shape with a constant width between them. The sugar is deoxyribose, a pentose sugar.

# Structure

Rosalind Franklin's X-ray crystallography suggested DNA has a helical shape with two strands.

|Purines|Pyrimidines|
|-------|-----------|
|A|T|
|G|C|
||U|

Purines, which are double-ringed, are twice as wide as pyrimidines, which are single-ringed.

Uracil replaces thymine in RNA.

# Experiments

There is lots of experimental evidence that was used to show DNA encodes genetic information.

## Hershey-Chase Experiment

This experiment compared protein matter to DNA matter from infected bacteria. Researchers initially thought genetic material was encoded with proteins because they knew proteins had a lot of variability in form and function whereas DNA was comparatively uniform in composition.

1. Label a batch of bacteriophages with radioactive sulfur incorporated into the proteins and a nother with radioactive phosphorus incorporated into the DNA.
2. Blend mixture of bacteriophages & bacteria

The labelled proteins were not found in bacteria but the DNA was.

## Chargaff

Chargaff analyzed DNA of different species and came up with Chargaff's rules:

1. DNA base composition varies b/w species
2. The percent of adenine = percent thymine; percent of cytosine = percent guanine.

## Griffith

He showed DNA can transform bacteria.

Transformation
: Change in genotype and phenotype due to assimilation of external DNA by cell

Oswald Avery et. al found DNA to be the *transforming factor*.
