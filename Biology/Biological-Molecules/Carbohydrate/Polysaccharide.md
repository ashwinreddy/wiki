Starch is a polysaccharide that plants use to store energy. Cellulose is also a polysaccharide used by plants in their cell walls. Starch is made up of $\alpha$-glucopyranose monomers while cellulose is made up of $\beta$-glucopyranose monomers. The result is that cellulose is more branched so that it can link more readily.

Glycogen is a polysaccharide used by animals and is stored in the liver. Glycogen is also highly branched while starch is not. Plants are more efficient at storing/packing b/c of linearity.
