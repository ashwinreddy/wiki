# Starch

Starch is a polysaccharide that plants use to store energy. They are stored as granules within plastids. The sugar can then be withdrawn by the plant through hydrolysis. Most animals have enzymes to hydrolyze plant starch. Most of the glucose monomers in starch are joined by 1-4 linkages. The simplest form of starch is amylose, which is unbranched. Amylopectin, a more complex starch, is a branched polymer with 1-6 linkages at the branch points. 

# Glycogen

Animals store a polysaccharide called **glycogen** which is like amylopectin but even more branched. Vertebrates store amylopectin mainly in liver and muscle cells. Hydrolysis of glycogen then releases glucose when the demand for sugar increases. A more branched molecule is easier to break as there are more free ends and more easily broken free ends.

# Cellulose

Cellulose is also a polysaccharide used by plants in their cell walls. Starch is made up of $\alpha$-glucopyranose monomers while cellulose is made up of $\beta$-glucopyranose monomers. The result is that cellulose is more branched so that it can link more readily.

Glycogen is a polysaccharide used by animals and is stored in the liver. Glycogen is also highly branched while starch is not. Plants are more efficient at storing/packing b/c of linearity.
