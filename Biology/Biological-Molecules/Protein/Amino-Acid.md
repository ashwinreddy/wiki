**Amino acids** are the monomers of [proteins](./Protein). They are organic compounds with an amine group, a carboxylic acid group, and an R group:

The central carbon is known as the $\alpha$-carbon.

This is a zwitterion in water because it has a polar/nonpolar, or is it acid/base?

# Side Chains

R groups, aka side chains, can confer:

- hydrophobic properties
- hydrophilic properties
- ionic properties

# Peptide Bonds

Linking two amino acids through a peptide bonds results in a dipeptide. A dipeptide can then be linked to another amino acid via a peptide bond to make a tripeptide. After that, the resultant is called a polypeptide. Peptide bonds are a type of dehydration synthesis. Now, simply by nature of having an amino end and a carboxyl end, the final result will have an N-terminus (the end which has a free amine group) and a C-terminus (the end which has a free carboxyl).

Notice in this picture that methionine, which acts as the start codon, has a sulfur group. However, it does not form sulfide bridges; that is not a sulfhydryl group. Cysteine, on the other hand, can.

Valine is hydrophobic? Why?

# Shape

Hydrophobic amino acids will fold inwards while hydrophilic ones will stay out. Acid and base amino acids will form salt bridges.

The folding of the protein at this stage gives the protein its 3D conformation as well as its function.
