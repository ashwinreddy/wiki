**Proteins** play important roles in biology. They make up 50% of the dry weight of cells. They are polymers, and their monomers are [amino acids](./Amino Acid).

# Protein Structure

|Structure Level|Associated Structure|Created As|
|---------------|--------------------|----------|
|Primary|Amino Acid sequence|Peptide Bond|
|Secondary|local 3d shape ($\alpha$-helix or $\beta$-sheet)|3D shape gained by Hydrogen bonding |
|Tertiary|general 3d shape| hydrophobic interaction and disulfide bridges|
|Quaternary|fibrous or globular|folded protein subunits|


Proteins can stop having structure after the secondary level.

Examples of globular proteins include antibodies and enzymes.

## Secondary Structure

$\beta$-pleated sheets (e.g. in spider silk) are created by hydrogen-bonding between the oxygen of the carboxyl group and the amino group. $\alpha$-helix for example occurs in hair. Both are caused by hydrogen-bonding from charged functional groups due to acid-base reactions.

# Function

Proteins are sentitive to physical and chemical conditions. The usual shape is called the native structure or conformation.

Chaperonins are proteins that provide an environment for folding proteins.

Alzheimer's and Parkinson's are believed to come from misfolded proteins.

# Denaturation

1. Heat
2. $\mathrm{pH}$
3. Salt concentration
