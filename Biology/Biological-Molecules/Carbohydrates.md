**Carbohydrates** are sugars and polymers of sugars. $\let\sb_$ The monomers of carbohydrates are called monosaccharides. Hydrocarbons are a source of energy. Hydrocarbons are nonpolar, which makes them hydrophobic.

# Monosaccharides

Also known as simple sugars, monosaccharides have the general chemical formula $\ce{ C_{n} H_{2n} O_{n}}$..

Hexose sugars are monosaccharides with $n=6$, which means they have the formula $\ce{C6H12O6}$. Glucose, fructose, and galactose all have this formula, which makes them isomers of each other. 

Glucose can be found in blood sugar.

# Disaccharide

A disaccharide is made up of two monosaccharides. An example is shown below:

Notice that the monosaccharides are linked by an oxygen. In this example, the linkage is called a 1-4 glycosydic linkage.

# Polysaccharides

Starch is a polysaccharide that plants use to store energy. Cellulose is also a polysaccharide used by plants in their cell walls. Starch is made up of $\alpha$-glucopyranose monomers while cellulose is made up of $\beta$-glucopyranose monomers. The result is that cellulose is more branched so that it can link more readily.

Glycogen is a polysaccharide used by animals and is stored in the liver. Glycogen is also highly branched while starch is not. Plants are more efficient at storing/packing b/c of linearity.
