Fat is a better energy storage than carbohydrates for fast-moving animals (carbs make us bloated by absorbing water? but carbs are nonpolar). Fats are esters of three fatty acid chains and glycerol, the three-carbon alcohol. Fats are also known as triglycerides.


|Saturated Fats|Unsaturated Fats|
|--------------|----------------|
| Filled with $\ce{H}$ | Not all carbons single bonding |
| Straight | Kinks from double bonds |
| Used by animals (e.g. butter or lard) | Used by plants (e.g. corn oil, olive oil)|
| Solid at room temperature | Liquid at room temperature |

Omega-3 fatty acids are harder to obtain, but neccessary. They come from fish and avocado, for example.

Fats are made via a dehydration synthesis:

\begin{equation}
\overbrace{\ce{C3H8O3}}^{\text{glycerol}} + 3 \text{ fatty acid chains} \to \text{triglycerides} + 3 \ce{H2O}
\end{equation}

Fats are linked by a polar ester linkage.

# Trans Fats
Enzymes can easily break the cis-oleic acid but cannot easily break the trans-oleic acid because of its linearity.

In the worse case, trans fats can float into the bload stream, causing plaque build up, and coronary artery disease

# Hydrogenation

Hydrogenation is opening up the double bonds in a fat. For example, corn oil is liquid at room temperature since it is unstaturated. By hydrogenating corn oil, we get margarine, solid at room temperature.
