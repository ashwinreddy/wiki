Monomers are repeating subunits that can be condensed (via dehydration synthesis) into polymers, which can, in turn, be chained to form macromolecules.

Dehydration synthesis: anabolic
Hydrolysis: catabolic

anabolic - making larger units from smaller ones.


Because hydrolysis is required to break down macromolecules, water is needed to digest food (which is why you should first find water, not food, if stuck in the desert).
