There are 4 main types of large molecules found in all living things:

- [Carbohydrates](./Carbohydrates)
- [Lipids](./Lipids/)
- [Proteins](./Amino-Acid)
- [Nucleic Acids](./Nucleic-Acid)

Of these, all but lipids are considered **macromolecules** for their huge size. These macromolecules are made of repeating subunits known as **monomers**, linked together through dehydration synthesis, an anabolic process. Breaking down macromolecules is known as **hydrolysis**. Because hydrolysis is required to break down macromolecules, water is needed to digest food (which is why you should first find water, not food, if stuck in the desert).
