Cyanobacteria are photoautotrophs. Bacteria can have flagella, fimbrae, and pili. They can use endospores to protect themselves in unfavorable conditions and re-absorb water to grow when conditions become favorable again.

Bacteria can release exotoxin proteins into the environment. Gram-negative bacteria release endotoxins upon ingestion or death.
