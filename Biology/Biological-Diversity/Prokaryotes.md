Prokaryotes do not have membrane-bound organelles. They also tend to be much smaller than eukaryotes. They belong to the domains [Archaea](./Archaea) and [Bacteria](./Bacteria).

Prokaryotes can take several shapes.

- coccus (spherical shape)
- bacillus (pill or rod shape)
- spirillum and spirochetes (spirals, short and long respectively)


The Gram test can tell if you a prokaryote has thick, simple walls (positive) or not (negative). Gram-positive bacteria have thicker layers of peptidoglycan.
