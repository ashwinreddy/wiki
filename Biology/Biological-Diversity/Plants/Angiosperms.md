**Angiosperms** use flower and fruit to disperse gametes and embryos, respectively. The sporophyte's male and female counterparts are the anther and ovary, respectively. The anther will create pollen grains, where they will hopefully travel to the stigma of another plant. The pollen grain will fall down the pollen tube into the ovary where a zygote will be formed into a seed. The seeds are dispersed by fruit, the ripened ovary. Some seeds are dispersed by air, others by animal fur or feces.
