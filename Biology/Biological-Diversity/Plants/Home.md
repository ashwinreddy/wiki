Plants had to do the following to live on land

1. maintain moisture in cells
2. obtain resources from soil and air
3. support the plant body (maintain vertically)
4. reproduce and disperse offspring without water

Algae ancestors of plants evolved to live above the water line during droughts. They had a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizae, a fungus that fixes nitrogen gas into nitrates and providing sugar to the host plant. And with few land-eating plants around, they could live long enough to reproduce.

The benefits of being on land are the access to sunlight and carbon dioxide.
