Nematodes have bilateral symmetry, three tissue layers, a pseudocoelom body cavity,
and a complete digestive tract. Nematodes play important ecological roles by cycling
nutrients in the soil. There are at least 50 species of parasitic nematodes, that can
stay in the intestines of their hosts, reproducing and causing digestive and other
problems for their host.
