Flatworms, which have three germ layers, are the simplest bilaterians and live in water-based environments. They acquire food through a “mouth” that comes out of the middle of their body.

They have a simple brain and primitive eyespots. They can act as parasites, using their hosts digestive tract in their life cycle (e.g. tapeworms).
