Annelids have segmentations and repeated structures, a brain, excretory organs, and a vascular circulatory
system. Earthworms feed on soil and dead/decaying plant matter, keeping the soil
moist and making it more accessible to decomposition by other micro-organisms.

Examples: Earthworms, leeches, polychaetes.
