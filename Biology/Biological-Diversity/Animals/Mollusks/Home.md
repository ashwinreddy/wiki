Mollusks have a muscular foot, an exoskeleton, and a mantle, which may secrete a
shell to protect it. The foot allows it to move around. The mantle cavity is the
respiratory chamber in most mollusks. They have a visceral mass that contains most of their internal organs. They have a true coelom.

[Gastropods](Gastropods), [bivalves](bivalves), [cephalopods](cephalopods).

Cephalopods have evolved the foot into a head with large brain; octopi and squid have specialized to have very good vision.
