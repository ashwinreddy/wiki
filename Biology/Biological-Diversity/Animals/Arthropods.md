Arthropods have jointed hinges, exoskeleton, and specialized segments (head,
thorax, abdomen). Arthropods have the most number of species and make up a
majority percentage of animals. The segmented body makes them very mobile, and
their jointed hinges allow for precise mechanical movement.

Insects can use their wings to fly, and they have a life cycle with short generations
and large numbers of offspring (so they spread very quickly). Insect mouthparts have
adapted for various kinds of feeding. For example, grasshoppers chew, but mosquitos
pierce and suck from humans.

- lobsters
- crab
