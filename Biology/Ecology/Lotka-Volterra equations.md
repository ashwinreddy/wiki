The **Lotka-Volterra equations** or **predator-prey equations** are two [[differential equation]]s describing the relationship between a predator (:fox:) and prey (:rabbit:) population.

\begin{align}
\dv{🐰}{t} &= 🐰\left(\alpha  - \beta 🦊\right) \\\\\
\dv{🦊}{t} &= 🦊\left(\delta 🐰 - \gamma \right)
\end{align}
