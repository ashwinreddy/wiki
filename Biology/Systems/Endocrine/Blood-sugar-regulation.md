Insulin and glucagon are antagonistic hormones, which means they act on opposite ends of a bounded equilibrium range. 

When blood sugar is too high (like after you've eaten a carbohydrate rich meal), the beta cells of the [pancreas](../digestive/pancreas) release insulin, which tells the liver to store the glucose as glycogen.

When blood sugar is too low, the alpha cells of the pancreas release glucagon to tell the liver to convert glycogen into glucose.
