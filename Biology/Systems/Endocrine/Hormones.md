A **hormone** is a regulatory chemical that travels in the blood from its production site to other target cells. They are made in endocrine glands.

There are steroid (lipid-soluble) hormones and non-steroid (water-soluble) hormones. Hormones signal in 4 steps:

1. release
2. reception
3. signal transduction
4. response


Steroid hormones can get through the membrane and activate a signal transduction pathway themselves. Other hormones have to bind to receptors on the membrane and have the cell activate the pathway for them.
