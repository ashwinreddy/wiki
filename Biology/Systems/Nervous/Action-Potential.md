Resting potential: -70 mV gradient set up by Na+/K+ pumps

Action potential: nerve signal caused by a stimulus exceeding the threshold potential. 

1. Na+ and K+ channels closed and interior of [neuron](neuron) membrane is negative compared to outside. 
2. Stimulus opens some Na+ channels if threshold is reached, then action potential is triggered. 
3. More Na+ channels open, interior of cell becomes more positive. 
4. Na+ channels close, K+ channels open and K+ rushes out of cell interior. 
5. K+ channels close slowly, leading to undershoot of resting potential.
