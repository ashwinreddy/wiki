**Neurons** are specialized cells in the brain that deliver electrical impulses through [action potentials](Action Potential).

The junction between neurons is known as a synapse. Neurons communicate at synapses: electrical or chemical.

Neuron structure: dendrites, cell body, axon, myelin sheath, nodes of Ranvier and synapse.

Interneurons are neurons that connect enable communication between the [PNS](PNS) and [CNS](CNS).
