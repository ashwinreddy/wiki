There are two photoreceptors: rods and cones. Cones are good for bright light and color. In dark settings, we use our rods.

The cornea forms the front of the eye. Light travels through the pupil, which is basically a hole, and the lens bends the light so that it hits the retina.

The lens can change shape/position based on how far away the object we want to focus on is.
