The **nephron** creates urine. The nephron extends from the renal cortex to medulla in the [kidney](kidneys). Blood enters from the renal artery into the Bowman's capsule, which contains the glomerulus that creates filtrate. The nephron tubule (consists of proximal tubule, loop of Henle, distal tubule) is in proximity to the capillary so that reabsorption and secretion can happen.
