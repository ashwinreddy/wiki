Animals create **nitrogenous wastes** through metabolism of proteins and nucleic acids. These ammonia-based compounds cannot be stored for extended periods of time for most animals. 

Most aquatic animals are surrounded by water, so they can excrete ammonia in dilute amounts of urine. 

Mammals and sharks convert the ammonia into urea, which is relatively nontoxic. The liver produces urea by combining ammonia with carbon dioxide and helps the kidney get rid of toxins.

Birds and reptiles turn it into uric acid, which does not take a lot of water. Uric acid is usually excreted as a semisolid paste. Uric acid also precipitates out of bird and reptile egg shells.
