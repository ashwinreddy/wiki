Organisms lie on a spectrum between endothermy (heat maintained by metabolism) and ectothermy (heat maintained by external sources). Some thermoregulatory adaptations include: 

- insulation (hair, fur, feathers, fat, blubber)
- when it is cold, organisms will keep blood away from the skin by narrowing them. dilated blood vessels means increased heat loss
- countercurrent heat exchange (the veins have slightly cooler blood, but they are close to the arteries, so the heat is maintained across)
- evaporative cooling (sweating)
- behavioral responses (shivering)
