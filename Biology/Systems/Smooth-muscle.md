Smooth muscles in the arteriole control how easily blood can flow out of the arteries into
the arterioles. Pre-capillary sphincters, rings of smooth muscle at the entrance of capillary
beds, also regulate the passage of blood into the branching capillaries.

During digestion, the sphincters relax to allow a lot of blood to pass so that the blood can
absorb the products of digestion. During exercise, on the other hand, the capillaries are
closed off. Blood flow to the skin is also regulated in order to control body temperature.

The contraction of smooth muscles is locally influenced by nerve impulses and
hormones. A wound causes increased blood flow and the supply of white blood cells.
