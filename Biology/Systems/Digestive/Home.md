All bilaterians have an alimentary canal, which has two openings: mouth and anus, unlike a gastrovascular cavity which has one opening.

The ingestion/eating phase mostly occurs in the [mouth](Mouth). Then comes digestion. In absorption, cells lining the digestive tract absorb small molecules. In elimination, undigested material passes through the tract.

Animals can be herbivores, carnivores, or omnivores. 

There are suspension feeders, substrate feeders (live on their food source like caterpillars), fluid feeders, bulk feeders.
