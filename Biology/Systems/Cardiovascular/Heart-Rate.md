The tempo of the heartbeat is determined by the SA and AV nodes.

1. The SA node sends out a signal for the contraction of the atria
2. The signal is delayed for about 0.1 seconds at the AV node
3. The signal reaches the apex of the heart
4. The signal forces powerful contractions with the ventricles
