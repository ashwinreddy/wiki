The cardiac cycle is the rhythm of contraction and relaxation of a four-chambered heart.
The cycle consists of two phases: diastole and systole. In diastole, blood flows into all
four chambers, and the ventricles nearly fill with blood. In systole, a very brief
contraction of the atria fills the ventricles, which then contract, pumping blood into the
large arteries.
