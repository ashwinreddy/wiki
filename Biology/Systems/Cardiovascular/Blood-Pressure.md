Blood pressure is the force exerted by [blood](blood) against the walls of the vessels. It is usually
measured in an artery in the arm around the height of the heart. A sphygmomanometer (blood pressure cuff) is inflated to the point that blood flow to the lower arm is cut off.
Then the cuff is deflated, and the pressure at the first sound of blood flow (heard by a
stethoscope) is the systolic pressure. The pressure once blood flows continuously is the
diastolic pressure. The lower the values for diastolic and systolic pressure (up to a certain
point), the better. Systole is the high number and diastole the low number

Hypertension is high blood pressure.
