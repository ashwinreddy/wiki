1. Right ventricle pumps oxygen-poor blood to the lungs
2. Blood flows through capillaries in the lungs and becomes oxygen-rich
3. The oxygen-rich blood flows back through the pulmonary veins to the left atrium
4. The oxygen-rich blood flows from the left atrium into the left ventricle
5. The left ventricle pumps oxygen-rich blood into the aorta
6. The oxygen-rich blood in the aorta branches off, leading to chest, head, arms, etc.
7. Oxygen-rich blood gives the oxygen it has at the capillaries
8. Oxygen-poor blood from from the upper half of the body goes to the superior vena
cava and from the lower half the inferior vena cava
9. The two vena cavae empty oxygen-poor blood into the right atrium
