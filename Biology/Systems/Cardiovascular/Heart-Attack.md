A heart attack is when cardiac muscle tissue is damaged or dies usually as the result of
blockage of blood vessels.

Treatment begins with clot-dissolving drugs, which stop many heart attacks and help
prevent damage. Drugs that lower cholesterol and blood pressure may also be used.
Cholesterol and blood pressure measurements as well as CT and MRI scans can help
identify people at risk. Of course, exercising daily, eating well, and avoiding smoking can
all reduce the risk of a heart attack.


Atherosclerosis: plaques in arteries, can cause heart attacks.
