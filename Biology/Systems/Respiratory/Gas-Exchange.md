The trachea separates into two bronchi with smaller and smaller tubes called bronchioles.
Alveoli at the end of the bronchioles facilitate the diffusion of oxygen across the
epithelial cells into the web of capillaries surrounding each alveolus and the diffusion of
CO2 the other way.

1. breathing: taking in gases you need and pushing ones that you don't need out
2. transport: gases are delivered through blood
3. exchange: cells give away carbon dioxide to blood and take in new oxygen
