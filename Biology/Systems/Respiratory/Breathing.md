Inhalation is negative pressure breathing. This means that a lower pressure is required in
the lungs for air to come in. When the diaphragm contracts, this pressure difference is
created as the ribs move out and the lungs expand. Air is pulled in through the nostrils or
mouth.


Exhalation just requires that the rib muscles and diaphragm relax. This decreases the
volume of the rib cage, increases the air pressure inside the lungs, and forces air out.
