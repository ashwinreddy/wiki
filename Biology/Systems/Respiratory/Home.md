Larger organisms need to make sure that all the different parts of their body are getting
enough oxygen. Unlike smaller animals, which may be able to supply all the oxygen by
breathing through their skin, larger animals rely on respiratory systems that provide a
large surface area to absorb enough oxygen for the organism and eliminate the carbon
dioxide byproduct.

The medulla oblongata (in the brain stem) coordinates the breathing rate with the need for
oxygen. The nerves in the breathing control center signal for diaphragm and rib muscle
contractions.
When too much carbon dioxide is in the bloodstream, the medulla senses a pH drop and
increases the rate and depth of breathing in an effort to eliminate the CO2. The aorta also
monitors concentrations of O2 and CO2, and send signals to the control center via nerves.

Maternal blood vessels and fetal capillaries connect at the placenta. The fetus’ blood
vessels are contained within the umbilical cord, so the capillaries just have to exchange
gases with with the maternal blood that circulates in the placenta. The mother’s
circulatory system handles the transportation of gases to and from her lungs. Fetal
hemoglobin also has a higher affinity for oxygen, which helps the baby capture enough
oxygen.
