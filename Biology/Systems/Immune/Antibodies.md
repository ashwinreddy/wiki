**Antibodies** are Y shaped proteins with 2 binding sites found in blood plasma. They bind to a specific antigen / the antigenic determinants.

They have a few tactical purposes:
1. neutralization: blocking the binding sites on antigens prevents the antigen from targeting a cell
2. agglutination: with 2 binding sites, antibodies can group up a number of antigens, which makes them more efficient to dispose of.
