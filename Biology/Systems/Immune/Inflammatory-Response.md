In **inflammatory response**, histamine is released. Blood vessels dilate and leak, and white blood cells move to the area to prevent pathogens from entering.

Classic symptoms: redness, swelling, heat, pain. The heat increases the metabolic rate of cells nearby so that they can work faster.

The release of histamine by mast cells makes the blood vessels more leaky, allowing platelets to clot up any abrasions or punctures.
