**Innate immunity** consists of nonspecific/generic defense mechanisms. Invertebrate innate immunity consists of just phagocytosis and the production of antimicrobial molecules. Vertebrate innate immunity uses external barriers and internal defenses. External barriers include

- hair
- skin
- mucuous membranes
- cilia
- acid from stomach

The internal defenses include phagocytic cells, [NK cells](Natural Killer Cells), [inflammatory response](inflammatory response). Infected cells will also produce interferons to limit the spread of the virus.
