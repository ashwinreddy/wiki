# Endocrine System

* Hormone vs Neurotransmitter
    * Neurotransmitter: between neurons
        * e.g. pain caused by substance P
        * local to the next neuron
        * much shorter but also quicker than hormones
    * Hormone: released throughout body
        * take longer than neurotransmitter, but lasts longer
    * Pheromones
        * Released from body
* Dopamine
    * Neurotransmitter
* Norepinephrine
    * Hormone
* Hypothalamus transitions between nervous system recognition perception to full body response
* Endocrine glands in blood stream
    * Target cells determined by receptors on the cell
        * Kidney cells have a specific protein just for ADH
        * Adrenaline targets a number of different cell types
    * Endocrine cell specialized to secrete/store this hormone
        * Rough ER creates secretory vesicles
        * Exocytosis out to release the hormone
* Adrenal gland near the kidneys
    * Chemical hormone to keep it lasting
    * But triggered by nervous signal 
* Neurosecretory cells
* Hypothalamus
* Pituitary gland
* Hormone Signaling (don’t need to specifically know 4 steps)
    * Release
    * Reception
    * Signal Transduction
    * Response
* Receptor protein on the surface of the cell (water-soluble / protein based / non steroid hormones cannot pass b/c they are charged/polar)
* Steroid hormones
    * Lipid = small, nonpolar that makes it easy to get into the cell
    * Turn on transcription factors to make proteins
    * testosterone and estrogen
    * Hormone- complex
        * goes to nucleus
        * creates mRNA which leaves the cell
* Vertebrate Endocrine System
    * > 12 glands, > 50 hormones
    * Glands
        * e.g. Hypothalamus, Pineal, Pituitary, Thyroid, parathyroid, thymus, adrenal, pancreas, ovary, testes
* Hypothalamus: master control center
    * Messages from rest of brain → messages to the body
    * Anterior pituitary 
    * posterior pituitary
        * ADH
        * oxytocin
