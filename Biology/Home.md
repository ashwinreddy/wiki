# Endocrine System

* Hormone vs Neurotransmitter
    * Neurotransmitter: between neurons
        * e.g. pain caused by substance P
        * local to the next neuron
        * much shorter but also quicker than hormones
    * Hormone: released throughout body
        * take longer than neurotransmitter, but lasts longer
    * Pheromones
        * Released from body
* Dopamine
    * Neurotransmitter
* Norepinephrine
    * Hormone
* Hypothalamus transitions between nervous system recognition perception to full body response
* Endocrine glands in blood stream
    * Target cells determined by receptors on the cell
        * Kidney cells have a specific protein just for ADH
        * Adrenaline targets a number of different cell types
    * Endocrine cell specialized to secrete/store this hormone
        * Rough ER creates secretory vesicles
        * Exocytosis out to release the hormone
* Adrenal gland near the kidneys
    * Chemical hormone to keep it lasting
    * But triggered by nervous signal 
* Neurosecretory cells
* Hypothalamus
* Pituitary gland
* Hormone Signaling (don’t need to specifically know 4 steps)
    * Release
    * Reception
    * Signal Transduction
    * Response
* Receptor protein on the surface of the cell (water-soluble / protein based / non steroid hormones cannot pass b/c they are charged/polar)
* Steroid hormones
    * Lipid = small, nonpolar that makes it easy to get into the cell
    * Turn on transcription factors to make proteins
    * testosterone and estrogen
    * Hormone- complex
        * goes to nucleus
        * creates mRNA which leaves the cell
* Vertebrate Endocrine System
    * more than 12 glands and 50 hormones
    * Glands
        * e.g. Hypothalamus, Pineal, Pituitary, Thyroid, parathyroid, thymus, adrenal, pancreas, ovary, testes
* Hypothalamus: master control center
    * Messages from rest of brain → messages to the body
    * Anterior pituitary 
    * posterior pituitary
        * ADH
        * oxytocin

# Homeostasis

* Temperature
    * Excess heat denatures proteins
    * Too cold slows down reactions, might leave with us no energy
        * heart beats slows down
        * not getting oxygen, etc. quickly enough
    * Injecting someone with high, low pH might also kill you
        * similar idea with salt
* Too hot
    * Sweat, evaporative cooling
        * High heat capacity
    * fan yourself
        * convection
    * don't move as much
    * conduction
        * touch something cool
        * in a cold bathroom, the tiles and mat are actually not different temperatures, but one takes away heat more quickly?
    * blood flow
        * More blood to skin during exercise
    * shade
    * dogs pant, their version of evaporative cooling
    * some animals shed
* All body processes release heat
    * Muscle contractions require ATP, producing heat
    * This is why if we were at 98.6 degrees outside, we would feel hot?
* Too cold
    * some animals pack more fat
    * hibernation
        * bears do not hibernate, they just sleep deeply and often
        * torpor: going dormant
        * shut down metabolically when it’s too cold
        * have to hide because they will be left vulnerable
* Estivation
    * Torpor during summer
    * E.g. toads
*  Bats: daily torpor
* Endothermic
    * active thermoregulation
* Ectothermic
    * rely on the outside environment for heat
    * they don’t have cold blood, per se (only when it is cold outside)
* Heat exchanges
    * Convection
        * Movement of air / water speeds up heat exchange
        * Convection oven: circulation of air heats up / speeds up
    * Radiation
        * Sunlight
    * Evaporation
    * Conduction
        * What feels colder might not be colder, but more heat transfer is happening
* Five categories of adaptations for thermoregulation
    * Increased heat production
    * Shivering
    * Increased physical activity
    * Hormonal changes boost metabolic rates?
* Insulation
    * Hair
    * feathers
    * fat layers
    * goosebumps
        * they don’t warm us up
        * vestigial reflex from birds
* Circulatory adaptations
    * increased blood flow to skin
    * jackrabbit & elephant ears release heat
    * countercurrent heat exchange
        * antiparallel arteries and veins
* Frostbite hits the extremities first
* Behavioral responses
    * migrating
    * v-formation
        * take turns with bird in the front
        * makes it easier aerodynamically for the ones in the back
* Osmoregulation & excretion
    * Over-hydrated
        * 
    * Under-hydrated
        * thirsty
    * No fish can live in both freshwater and saltwater environments
        * salmon go to freshwater to give birth and go to the salt water later
    * Osmoconformers
        * can deal with high salt water concentration
    * Osmoregulators
        * control solute concentrations
        * gain water by osmosis
        * excrete excess water
        * pump salt across gills
* Breaking down proteins creates ammonia for mammals and amphibians
* Aquatic animals produce ammonia, birds and reptiles and insects produce uric acid
* High salt in the blood means that cells shrivel, also damages proteins
    * Fish have evolved proteins that work at higher salt concentration
    * They can urinate out ammonia due to the high availability of water
    * Animals and birds use a little bit of water/energy to turn them into less toxic forms
* Urine
    * liquid
    * removes ammonia (very toxic)
        * turns into urea (ergo, urine)
    * comes from circulated blood
    * regulation of water: osmoregulation
    * over-hydrated
        * urinating is just flushing out excess water, colorless
    * dehydrated
        * more concentrated with urea (body reabsorbs the water when it is needed via a hormone), therefore, darker
* Feces
    * undigested/unabsorbed food material
* Mammalian urinary system
    * Getting rid of metabolic waste
    * Blood coming from heart out the aorta to the kidneys
        * renal (adj. for kidney) arteries bring blood to kidneys
        * kidney filters the blood
        * urine comes out to the ureter to the bladder
        * nervous sytem → sphincter → urine leaves
    * Nephron: filtering unit of kidney
        * blood branches out to hit each nephron
        * Do not need to know Bowman’s capsule
        * Blood capillaries meet the nephron tubule
            * blood pressure forces out blood that can be forced out (nonspecific)
            * the non-pecificity means that we lose glucose, vitamins, minerals, etc. which we want to reabsorb
            * some urea comes in
        * Reabsorption and filtration happening simultaneously
            * excess protons for example will be filtered out
        * Filtering
            * also driven by concentration gradient
        * Specific filtration/reabsorption
            * specific channels, probably passive?
        * active transport of sodium
        * aquaporin
    * Steps
        * Filtration
        * Reabsorption
            * Return the good stuff
        * Secretion
        * Excretion
    * Proximal tubule → 
    * loop of Henle →
        * pump salt down the bottom so water will osmose out (control of aquaporins to reabsorb water based on whether we are over hydrated or dehydrated)
        * Hormone: ADH (anti-diuretic hormone)
        * Diuretics: alcohol, caffeine (tricks body into thinking we’re hydrated)
    * distal tubule
* Renal failure
    * Dialysis: external artificial kidney
    * Draws blood and uses dialysis tubing

# Digestive System

* Herbivores eat plants, carnivores eat meat, omnivores eat both
* Types of feeding mechanisms (not a focus)
    * Filter feeders
    * Substrate feeders
    * Fluid feeders
    * Bulk feeders
* Phases of Digestion
    * Ingestion: eating
        * Tongue & mouth to pharynx
    * Digestion: breakdown of food
        * Mechanically breakdown
        * Chemical breakdown
    * Absorption:
        * Cells lining digestive tract absorb small molecules
    * Elimination
        * Undigested material passes the tract
* Digestion mechanism
    * Gastrovascular cavity
        * single opening for food and waste
    * Alimentary canal
        * Pharynx/throat
        * Next is either a crop or a gizzard or a stomach
        * Organ that softens and stores food (for children)
        * Muscular gizzard stores food temporarily, churning and grinding food
        * Chemical digestion in intestine
        * Undigested material through anus
    * Grasshoppers have gastric pouches and a hindgut (like a colon)
* Mechanical digestion
    * breaking food down into smaller pieces, easier to swallow and more surface area exposed to digestive fluids
* Where are the polymers digested?
    * Lipid
        * small intestine (lipase from pancreas, bile from liver)
    * Protein
        * stomach (pepsinogen), small intestine
    * Nucleic Acid
        * Small Intestine (pancreas)
    * Carbohydrates
        * Mouth (amylase), stomach
* Digestion in the oral cavity
    * Teeth break up food, saliva moistens it
        * Enzymes to hydrolyze starch
        * buffers to neutralize acid
        * antibacterial agents
    * Tongue creates a bolus of food and moves it toward the pharynx (epiglottis)
* Peristalsis
    * Alternative waves of contraction and relaxation by smooth muscles to move food
    * Sphincters control movement into and out of digestive chambers
        * pyloric sphincter: regulate passage of food from stomach to small intestine
* Stomach
    * Parietal cells secrete hydrogen and chloride ions to make HCl
    * Acid kills bacteria & breaks apart cells in food
    * Chief cells produce pepsinogen, activated with acid, breaking down proteins
    * Stomach outputs acid chyme
    * Mucus and constant relining keeps the stomach from being digested
* Acid reflux is when stomach acid goes back up the esophagus
* Small intestine
    * First portion is the duodenum
    * Acid chyme neutralized by alkaline pancreatic juice before entering the sm. intestine
    * Bile, made by liver and stored in gallbladder, acts as an emulsifying agent for fat
    * Surface area of absorption is increased by folds and villi
* Liver: stores and processes nutrients
    * Glucose turned into glycogen
    * Synthesizes proteins (e.g. blood clotting, lipoproteins)
    * Produces bile
    * Detoxification
* Appendix: junction between small intestine and colon
* Cecum: useful for digesting plants
* Large intestine: reclaim water and compact feces
    * More than half of feces is E. coli bacteria
* Dietary modifications
    * Carnivores have shorter tracts than herbivores and omnivores
    * Herbivores have rumination
* Chemical energy
    * Basal metabolic rate and metabolic rate
    * Excess energy as glycogen or fat
    * Undernourishment: not enough calories
    * Malnourishment: missing essential nutrients
* Minerals
    * Calcium & phosphorus
* Everything happens in stages
    * Boluses are dealt with one at a time
    * The stomach squirts just a bit of chyme to small intestine and waits to squirt more
* Fun facts
    * Humpback whales strain krill from seawater with baleens
    * Sponges digest food with vacuoles
