A northern blot determines gene expression in a sample or changes in gene expression at different stages of embryonic development.

1. Run a gel electrophoresis with samples of mRNA from different stages
2. Transfer samples to nitrocellulose membrane
3. mRNAs hybridize with labeled probe complementary to gene in question
4. Expose membrane to film
5. If mRNA seen at particular stage, protein functions at that stage.
