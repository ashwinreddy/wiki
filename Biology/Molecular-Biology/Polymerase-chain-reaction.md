**Polymerase chain reaction** (PCR) makes copies of a specific DNA segment.

1. Heat DNA, denaturing it and splitting the complimentary strands
2. Cool the DNA so that primers anneal ([[hydrogen bond]] to each of the single strands)
3. Allow DNA polymerase to add nucleotides


|Advantages|Disadvantages|
|----------|-------------|
|PCR is very quick|Prone to errors|
|Can target specific genes|Cannot clone large amounts|
