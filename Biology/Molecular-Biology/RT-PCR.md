**Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)**
detects RNA transcription levels.

1. [[mRNA]]s from different stages are isolated
2. Reverse transcriptase forms cDNA
3. Do a [[Polymerase chain reaction] on the cDNA
4. Run gel electrophoresis

Copies of the amplified region will only appear in samples that contained the mRNA of interest.
