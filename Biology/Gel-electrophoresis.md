**Gel electrophoresis** is a method for separation and analysis of macromolecules ([[DNA]], RNA and proteins) and their fragments, based on their size and charge using a gel made of polymer acting as a molecular sieve.

Because DNA is negatively charged, it will move towards the positive electrode. Smaller fragments will move farther ahead.

You can use gel electrophoresis to distinguish between different alleles because restriction enzymes will cut them at different sites and thus give them different lengths.
