**Primates** are [[mammals|mammal]]. All primates share:

- grasping hands and feet
- nails on at least the first toe
- eyes that are more or less directed to the front of the face
- reliance on vision as predominant sense
- enlarged brains


There are two major schools of thought about where primates initially evolved, based on the initial supercontinents of Laurasia (North America, Asia) and Gondwana (Africa, South America, Antarctica, Australia, India, Pakistan, Madigascar). But it remains to be seen.

Why did they evolve? 

Arboreal theory
: Primates lost olfaction and gained sight and grasping because that's what's important for living in trees

Visual Predation hypothesis
: Grasping and vision are needed to eat insects

Angiosperm/Omnivore Hypothesis
: Grasping and vision are needed to eat fruit
