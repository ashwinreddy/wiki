**Primates** are [[mammals|mammal]]. All primates share:

- grasping hands and feet
- nails on at least the first toe
- eyes that are more or less directed to the front of the face
- reliance on vision as predominant sense
- enlarged brains


There are two major schools of thought about where primates initially evolved, based on the initial supercontinents of Laurasia (North America, Asia) and Gondwana (Africa, South America, Antarctica, Australia, India, Pakistan, Madigascar).
