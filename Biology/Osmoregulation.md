**Osmoregulation** is a biological organism's control over solute concentration and water balance. 

To determine what happens to a cell in solution, we use the concept of **tonicity**, the tendency of a solution to cause a cell to gain or lose water. Basically, substitute the word "tonic" for "salty" and it should be clear how to proceed. 

# Without a cell wall

Animal cells, for example, respond in the following ways:

|Hypotonic Solution |Isotonic Solution|Hypertonic Solution|
|---------|----------|---------|
|Less Salty Solution means water goes in, causing a burst or **lysis**|Equally salty solution means stable equilibrium|Hyper salty solution means water moves out, the cell shrivels|

# With a cell wall

|Hypotonic Solution |Isotonic Solution|Hypertonic Solution|
|---------|----------|---------|
|Less Salty Solution means water goes in, causing a swelling as the cell wall pushes back. **Turgor pressure** means the cell is **turgid**, which is the natural operating condition|Equally salty solution means the cell is **flaccid** and not as rigid as it should be|Hyper salty solution means water moves out, the cell **plasmolyses** as the plasma membrane pulls from the cell wall|
