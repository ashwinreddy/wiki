**Osmoregulation** is a biological organism's control over solute concentration and water balance. 

To determine what happens to a cell in solution, we use the concept of **tonicity**, the tendency of a solution to cause a cell to gain or lose water. Basically, substitute the word "tonic" for "salty" and it should be clear how to proceed. For example, a cell without a cell wall, like an animal cells responds in the following ways:

|Hypotonic|Isotonic|Hypertonic|
