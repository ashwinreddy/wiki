A **virus** is an obligate intracellular parasite (must reproduce inside an infected host cell) consisting of a [nucleic acid](../Biological-Molecules/Nucleic-Acid/) surrounded by a [[capsid]]. The nucleic acid could be [[DNA]] or RNA and in either single-stranded or double-stranded forms, and the genome is organized either as a linear or circular molecule (some genomes even have multiple molecules). 

Viruses have a limited number of host species, called the **host range**. They usually identify the host cell by a fit between the viral surface proteins and specific receptor molecules on the cells. Host ranges for some viruses can be quite broad or very limited.


Some viruses are surrounded by a membranous envelope called the **viral envelope**. Viral envelopes are derived from the membranes of the host cells, and they contain host cell phospholipids and membrane proteins. 

Viruses can inject their DNA or be taken up by endocytosis or the viral envelope can fuse with the plasma membrane. This leads to [[viral replication]]


Viruses were discovered when scientists observed that rubbing the sap of diseased plants on healthy plants caused the healthy plants to become diseased.

|Living|Non-living|
|------|----------|
|Uses a genetic code|Can only reproduce within host cell|
|Evolutionary connection to living world|No ribosomes to make proteins|
|Probably evolved after life first appeared|Generally no source of energy|

The original source for viral genomes could be plasmids or transposons, which, like viruses, are mobile genetic elements.

Viruses often share genetic information with their hosts but they also share genetic information with other viruses.

# Symptoms

- Damaged or killed cells caused by the release of hydrolytic enzymes from lysosomes
- Cells producing toxins or molecular components of virus are toxic

# Emergence 

- Mutation of exiting viruses. RNA viruses have high mutation rates because viral RNA polymerase does not proofread or correct errors.
- Dissemination of viral disease from small, isolated population
- Spread of viruses from animals
