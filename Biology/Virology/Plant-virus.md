**Plant viruses** affect plants.

In horizontal transmission, the virus infects a plant _A_ by spreading from a neighboring plant _B_. Plant _A_ may have been injured by wind, chilling, or insects. In fact, the insects may actually themselves carry the virus.

In vertical transmission, plant _A_ acquires the virus from its parents.
