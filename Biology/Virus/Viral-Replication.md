The basic outline of the viral replicative cycle follows:

1. The virus enters the cell and is uncoated, releasing its DNA and [[capsid]] proteins.
2. Host enzymes replicative the viral genome while host enzymes transcribe the viral genome into viral mRNA.
3. The host ribosomes use the viral mRNA to make capsid proteins.
4. The viral genomes and capsid proteins self-assembled into new viruses and exit.
