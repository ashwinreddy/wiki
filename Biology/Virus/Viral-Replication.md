The basic outline of the viral replicative cycle follows:

1. The virus enters the cell and is uncoated, releasing its DNA and [[capsid]] proteins.
2. Some host enzymes replicate the viral genome and others transcribe it into viral mRNA.
3. The host ribosomes use the viral mRNA to make capsid proteins.
4. The viral genomes and capsid proteins self-assembled into new viruses and exit.

# Enveloped RNA virus

Animal viruses are more likely than phages to have envelopes. 

1. Glycoproteins on viral envelope bind to specific receptor molecules on host cell, promoting viral uptake.
2. Capsid and viral genome enter. Cellular enzymes digest capsid, releasing viral genome
3. The viral genome is copied by creating the compliment of the compliment of the viral genome
4. The complimentary RNA is translated into capsid proteins in the cytosol and glycoproteins for the viral envelope (in the ER and Golgi apparatus)
5. Vesicles transport envelope glycoproteins to plasma membrane
6. Capsid assembles around viral genome
7. Virus buds off with envelope studded with viral glycoproteins

Host cell left alive.

# Retrovirus

1. Envelope glycoproteins enable virus to bind to specific receptors on cells
2. Virus fuses with cell's plasma membrane. Capsid proteins are removed, releasing viral proteins and RNA.
3. Reverse transcriptase catalyzes synthesis of a DNA strand complimentary to viral RNA
4. Reverse transcriptase cataylzes synthesis of DNA strand complimentary to the one above
5. DNA incorporated into cell as a **provirus**
6. Proviral genes transcribed 
7. Vesicles transport glycoproteins to plasma membrane
8. Capsid assembles around viral genomes and reverse transcriptase molecules
9. Buds from host
