A **virus** consists of a [nucleic acid](../Biological-Molecules/Nucleic-Acid/) surrounded by a [[capsid]]. The nucleic acid could be [[DNA]] or [[RNA]] and in either single-stranded or double-stranded forms, and the genome is organized either as a linear or circular molecule (some genomes even have multiple molecules). 

Viruses were discovered when scientists observed that rubbing the sap of diseased plants on healthy plants caused the healthy plants to become diseased. 

Some viruses are surrounded by a membranous envelope.
