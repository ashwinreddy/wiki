A **virus** is an obligate intracellular parasite (must reproduce inside an infected host cell) consisting of a [nucleic acid](../Biological-Molecules/Nucleic-Acid/) surrounded by a [[capsid]]. The nucleic acid could be [[DNA]] or RNA and in either single-stranded or double-stranded forms, and the genome is organized either as a linear or circular molecule (some genomes even have multiple molecules). 

Viruses were discovered when scientists observed that rubbing the sap of diseased plants on healthy plants caused the healthy plants to become diseased. 

Some viruses are surrounded by a membranous envelope called the **viral envelope**. Viral envelopes are derived from the membranes of the host cells, and they contain host cell phospholipids and membrane proteins. 

Viruses have a limited number of host species, called the **host range**. They usually identify the host cell by a fit between the viral surface proteins and specific receptor molecules on the cells. Host ranges for some viruses can be quite broad or very limited.

Viruses can inject their DNA or be taken up by endocytosis or the viral envelope can fuse with the plasma membrane. This leads to [[viral replication]]
