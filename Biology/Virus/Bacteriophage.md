A **bacteriophage** (or **phage**) is a type of virus that infects and replicates within bacteria and archaea.

Phages don't all follow the same replicative cycle: there is the **lytic cycle**, which results in the host dying, and the **lysogenic cycle**, where the host continues to replicate the phage genome without dying.

Virulent phage
: A phage that can replicate only by a lytic cycle

Temperate phage
: A phage that can replicate by either lytic or lysogenic cycle

The lytic cycle follows the basic outline as described in the [[Viral Replication]] article. 

# Lytic Cycle

For example, a T4 phage will use its tail fibers to bind to proteins on an _E. coli_ cell that act as receptors. The sheath of the tail contracts, injecting the phage DNA into the cell and leaving an empty capsid outside. The cell's DNA is hydrolyzed. The phage DNA directs the production of phage proteins and copies of phage genome by host and viral enzymes, using components within the cell. The proteins self-assemble to form a phage. The phage directs production of an enzyme to damage the cell wall; the cell bursts, releasing phages.

# Lysogenic Cycle

The DNA of the virus is incorporated into a specific site on the bacterial chromosome (viral proteins will break the circular DNA molecule and insert the viral DNA, which is now known as a **prophage** inside the bacteria). However, there's one gene on the prophage gene that prevents transcription of most of the other genes. When the bacteria divides, the prophage is carried along with it. 

An environmental signal triggers the switchover from lysogenic to lytic.
