A **bacteriophage** (or **phage**) is a type of virus that infects and replicates within bacteria and archaea.

Phages don't all follow the same replicative cycle: there is the **lytic cycle**, which results in the host dying, and the **lysogenic cycle**, where the host continues to replicate the phage genome without dying.

Virulent phage
: A phage that can replicate only by a lytic cycle

Temperate phage
: A phage that can replicate by either lytic or lysogenic cycle

The lytic cycle follows the basic outline as described in the [[Viral Replication]] article.
