**Cellular differentation** is the process by which cells become specialized in structure and function. It is marked by the production of tissue-specific proteins.

For example, myoblasts produce muscle-specific proteins and form skeletal muscle cells. MyoD protein is a transcription factor that binds to enhancers of various target genes. So once a embryonic precursor cell makes MyoD, it triggers a cascade of more and more proteins to make muscle cell proteins.

Induction
: Transcriptional changes in one cell propagate locally to nearby cells. Cells triggered to differentiate.

Interactions between cells induce differentiation of specialized cell types.

Cell-cell signals are molecules produced by one cell influencing neighboring cells (e.g. growth factors).
