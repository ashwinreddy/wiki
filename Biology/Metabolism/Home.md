**Metabolism** is the totality of an organism's chemical reactions. Metabolic pathways are chains of rxns that turn a reactant into a product.

Metabolism is never at equilibrium.

**Catabolism** refers to a breakdown pathway (energy-releasing) while **anabolism** refers to a synthetic or constructive pathway (energy-requiring).

**Bioenergetics** is the study of how energy flows through living organisms.
