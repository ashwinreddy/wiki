There are two main subfields of bioinformatics: genomics, studying genes, and proteomics, studying proteins.

The Human Genome Project successfully sequenced the human genome in 2003.

# Approach #1

1. Create a linkage map looking for gene markers and using recombination frequencies
2. Create a physical map with distance between markers as number of base pairs
3. DNA sequencing

# Whole-Genome Shotgun Approach

Method of choice now

1. Cut DNA with overlaps using restriction enzymes
2. Clone fragments in plasmid/phage vectors
3. Sequence each fragment
4. Order sequence with software

Metagenomics
: Collecting a sample from an environment and sequencing all species within it
