# Fats

Fat is a better energy storage than carbohydrates for fast-moving animals. Fats are esters of three fatty acid chains and glycerol, the three-carbon alcohol. Fats are also known as triglycerides.

Omega-3 fatty acids are harder to obtain, but neccessary. They come from fish and avocado, for example.
