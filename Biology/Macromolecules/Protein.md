|Structure Level|Associated Structure|
|---------------|--------------------|
|Primary|Amino Acid sequence|
|Secondary|$\alpha$-helix or $\beta$-sheet|
|Tertiary||
|Quaternary||

$\alpha$-helix for example occurs in hair. $\beta$-pleated shets occur in spider webs. Both are caused by hydrogen-bonding from charged functional groups due to acid-base reactions.

Proteins can stop having structure after the secondary level.
