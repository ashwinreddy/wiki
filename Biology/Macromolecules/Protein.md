**Proteins** play important roles in biology. They make up 50% of the dry weight of cells.



Amino Acid: contains a amine and a carboxylic acid.

The central carbon is known as the $\alpha$-carbon.

This is a zwitterion in water because it has a polar/nonpolar, or is it acid/base?

# Protein Structure

|Structure Level|Associated Structure|
|---------------|--------------------|
|Primary|Amino Acid sequence|
|Secondary|$\alpha$-helix or $\beta$-sheet|
|Tertiary||
|Quaternary||

$\alpha$-helix for example occurs in hair. $\beta$-pleated shets occur in spider webs. Both are caused by hydrogen-bonding from charged functional groups due to acid-base reactions.

peptide bonds link amino acids.

Proteins can stop having structure after the secondary level.

proteins can be fibrous or globular.
