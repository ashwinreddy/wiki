**Proteins** play important roles in biology. They make up 50% of the dry weight of cells. They are polymers, and their monomers are [amino acids](./Amino Acid).

# Protein Structure

|Structure Level|Associated Structure|Created As|
|---------------|--------------------|----------|
|Primary|Amino Acid sequence|Peptide Bond|
|Secondary|local 3d shape ($\alpha$-helix or $\beta$-sheet)|3D shape gained by Hydrogen bonding |
|Tertiary|general 3d shape|
|Quaternary|folded protein subunits|

$\beta$-pleated sheets (e.g. in spider silk) are created by hydrogen-bonding between the oxygen of the carboxyl group and the amino group.

$\alpha$-helix for example occurs in hair. $\beta$-pleated shets occur in spider webs. Both are caused by hydrogen-bonding from charged functional groups due to acid-base reactions.

peptide bonds link amino acids.

Proteins can stop having structure after the secondary level.

proteins can be fibrous or globular.
