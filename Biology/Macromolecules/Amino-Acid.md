**Amino acids** are the monomers of [proteins](./Protein). They are organic compounds with an amine group, a carboxylic acid group, and an R group:

The central carbon is known as the $\alpha$-carbon.

This is a zwitterion in water because it has a polar/nonpolar, or is it acid/base?

R groups can confer:

- hydrophobic properties
- hydrophilic properties
- ionic properties

# Proteins

Linking two amino acids through a peptide bonds results in a dipeptide. A dipeptide can then be linked to another amino acid via a peptide bond to make a tripeptide. After that, the resultant is called a polypeptide. Peptide bonds are a type of dehydration synthesis.

Notice in this picture that methionine, which acts as the start codon, has a sulfur group. However, it does not form sulfide bridges; that is not a sulfhydryl group.
