**Carbohydrates** are a macromolecule, made up of hydrogen and carbon. The monomers of carbohydrates are called monosaccharides. Monosaccharides have the general chemical formula $\rm{C}\sb{n}\rm{H}_{2n}\rm{O}\sb{n}$. 

# Monosaccharides

Hexose sugars are monosaccharides with $n=6$, which means they have the formula $\ce{C6H12O6}$. Glucose, fructose, and galactose all have this formula, which makes them isomers.


# Polysaccharides

Starch is a polysaccharide that plants use to store energy. Cellulose is also a polysaccharide used by plants in their cell walls. 

Glycogen is a polysaccharide used by animals. Glycogen is stored in the liver.


Blood sugar, for example, contains the monosaccharide hexose sugar glucose, whose chemical formula is $\ce{C6H12O6}$.

Polymer (polysaccharide) examples:

- starch (how plants store energy)
- cellulose


Glucose, fructose, galactose are isomers
