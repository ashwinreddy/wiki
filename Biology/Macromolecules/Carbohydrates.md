The monomers of carbohydrates are called monosaccharides, which have the general formula $\ce{CnH2nOn}$.

Blood sugar, for example, contains the monosaccharide glucose, whose chemical formula is $\ce{C6H12O6}$.

The animal form of stored carbohydrate is called glycogen and is stored in the liver.

Polymer (polysaccharide) examples:

- starch (how plants store energy)
- cellulose
