**Carbohydrates** are a macromolecule, made up of hydrogen and carbon. The monomers of carbohydrates are called monosaccharides, which have the general formula $\rm{C}\sb{n}\rm{H}_{2n}\rm{O}\sb{n}$.





Blood sugar, for example, contains the monosaccharide hexose sugar glucose, whose chemical formula is $\ce{C6H12O6}$.

The animal form of stored carbohydrate is called glycogen and is stored in the liver.

Polymer (polysaccharide) examples:

- starch (how plants store energy)
- cellulose


Glucose, fructose, galactose are isomers
