Ecology is the study of interactions of organisms with environments.


The biosphere is made up living and nonliving factors as well as chemical factors.


The ecosystem is made up of the community, biotic (all living organisms) factors, and abiotic factors (solar energy, wind, water, temperature, etc.).

The community is population of organisms living close enough to interact. The population is organisms of a species living in an area. 

Plants and therefore animals and terrestrial biome determined by the availability of water and solar energy (tropical regions get more solar energy). Climate due to angle of incoming solar radiation and tilt of the Earth.

Rain shadows explain why mountains tend to have dry land on the opposite side of a body of water.

Seasons determined by the tilt of the Earth towards the sun.
