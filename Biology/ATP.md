**Adenosine triphosphate** is a nucleoside triphosphate made with adenine. ATP is used as energy because its last bond is so high-energy (and therefore unstable) from the highly polar bond. 

\begin{equation}
\text{ATP} + \ce{H2O} \to \text{ADP} + \text{P}_i + \text{energy}
\end{equation}

Note that $\Delta G = -7.3 \mathrm{\frac{kcal}{mol}}$.

The three posphate groups are negatively charged, so their mutual repulsion contributes to the instability of of the molecule.
