**CRISPR** (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic sequences) 

CRISPR sequences are repetitive sequences that contain palindromes and spacer DNA between the repeats. Scientists were unsure of what the spacer DNA was and believed it to be random until they discovered that it matched up with sequences from phages that had infected the cell. 

Cas (CRISPR-associated) proteins identify and cut phage DNA. When a phage infects a bacterial cell with a CRISPR-Cas system system, the DNA of the phage is integrated between repeat sequences. If the same type of phage infects this cell or its offspring again, it will trigger transncription of the CRISPR region into RNA. Cas proteins use bind to cut up RNA to find the phage and kill it.
