**Bacteria** are special prokaryotic unicellular organisms. In bacteria, most genes are carried on a single chromosome that consists of circular DNA molecules and associated proteins.

Binary [[fission]] begins when the DNA replicates at the origin of replication. One copy moves to an end of the cell. Then, each copy is at an end of the cell while the cell elongates. A new cell wall is formed.

# Defense against Phages

- Lysogeny spares bacteria from death
- Natural selection favors bacterial mutants with surface proteins that are no longer recognized as receptors by a particular type of phage
- Phage DNA can be identified as foreign and cut up by [[restriction enzyme]].
