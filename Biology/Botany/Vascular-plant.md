**Vascular plants** are [[embryophyte]]s with vascular tissue to distribute resources through the plant.

Evolutionarily, plants that can more efficiently capture light from the sun and $\ce{CO2}$ from the air have an advantage. Leaves with a higher surface area can capture more light, and more open stomatal pores allows more $\ce{CO2}$ to diffuse. However, the latter also leads to evaporation of water from the plant. Thus, there is a compromise that must be made between more efficient energy uptake and minimizing water loss.

# Absorption of Water and Minerals

Epidermal cells near the tips of roots absorb soil solution.

# Transport of Water and Minerals

How are water and minerals transported from roots to shoots?

1. Soil solution takes the [[apoplast]]ic route.
2. Minerals and water take [[symplast]]ic route.
3. Minearls and water can move inward by transmembrane route.
4. Minerals by symplast pass into vascular cylinder.
