# Stimuli for Stomatal Opening and Closing

Stomata are open during the day but closed at night as to prevent water loss while photosynthesis cannot occur.

- Light stimulates guard cells to accumulate $\ce{K+}$ by blue-light receptors in guard cell plasma membrane.
- As $\ce{CO2}$ depletes, the stomata open up if water is supplied to the leaf
- Internal clock in guard cells.

[[Abscisic acid]] (ABA) closes stomata when water is deficient.
