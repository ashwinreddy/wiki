**Abscisic acid** (ABA) slows growth, antagonistic to auxins, gibberellins, cytokinins.

# Seed Dormancy

Increases likelihood that seeds will germinate only when there is sufficient light, temperature, and moisture. What can activate dormant seeds? Depends on the seed. Here are some of the triggers:

- ABA is moved or inactivated
- Heavy rain washes ABA away
- Light or prolonged exposure to cold

# Drought Tolerance

When a plant begins to wilt, ABA accumulates in leaves and closes stomata to prevent water loss.
