The **endodermis** is the innermost layer of cells in the root cortex. Each endodermal cell has a Casparian strip, a waxy material.

The endodermis transports needed minerals from the soil into the xylem and keeps many unneeded or toxic substances out. The endodermis also prevents solutes that have accumulated in the xylem from leaking back into the soil solution.
