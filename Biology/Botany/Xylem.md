**Xylem** transport water and minerals from root to shoots.

# Cohesion-Tension Hypothesis

Transpiration pulls the xylem sap and the cohesion of water molecules transmits the pull along the entire length of the xylem from shoots to roots.

## Transpirational Pull

1. Air drier outside the leaf than inside
2. Water potential lower outside than inside
3. Water vapor moves out
4. Water from xylem moves in to replace lost water
5. Cohesion pulls all the water along with it
