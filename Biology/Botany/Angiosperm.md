Two mechanisms to prevent self-fertilization are self-incompatibility and incomplete flowers.

# Reproduction

Female gametophyte (embryo sac) develops inside each ovule, beginning when one cell in the megasporangium of each ovule undergoes meiosis, producing four haploid megaspores. Only one megaspore survives, the rest degenerate. Divides by mitosis three times without cytokinesis to make one large cell with eight haploid nuclei.

Each anther develops four microsporangia called pollen sacs. Within the microsporangia are many diploid cells called microsporocytes, they undergo meiosis to form four haploid microspores, each turns into a haploid male gametophyte. These undergo mitosis to make a gametophyte of two cells: generative cell and tube cell.

- Pollen grain consists of generative cell, tube cell, and spore wall


Fertilization of polar nuclei forms the endosperm.
