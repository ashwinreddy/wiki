**Transpiration** is the loss of water vapor from leaves and other aerial parts of plants. The rate of transpiration is regulated by stomata. Each stoma is flanked by a pair of guard cells, which control the diamater of the stoma by widening or narrowing the gap between the pair. 

When the guard cells take in water, they become turgid and due to their shape they bow out, creating an opening. Stomatal opening is due to accumulation of $\ce{K+}$ and active transport of $\ce{H+}$ out of the guard cell.
