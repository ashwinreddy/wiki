**Mammals** are [[vertebrates|vertebrate]] in which the females produce milk.

> Mammals, including primates, have two visual systems that do different but complementary things. The LGN visual system is more involved with becoming aware of details through vision whereas the SC-pulvinar system is more involved with automatic, non-conscious vision, particularly as it pertains to avoiding predators, and, for primates, motor actions such as hand-eye coordination. The other key point is that primates have modified and expanded both visual systems, and the changes suggest that the ancestral environment of primates uniquely affected them to link vision with automatic, fast, accurate, and adjustable reaching and grasping, and to improve upon vision as a way to detect and avoid predators, both automatically and with conscious awareness.
