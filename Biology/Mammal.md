**Mammals** are [[vertebrates|vertebrate]] in which the females produce milk.

> Mammals, including primates, have two visual systems that do different but complementary things. The LGN visual system is more involved with becoming aware of details through vision whereas the SC-pulvinar system is more involved with automatic, non-conscious vision, particularly as it pertains to avoiding predators, and, for primates, motor actions such as hand-eye coordination. The other key point is that primates have modified and expanded both visual systems, and the changes suggest that the ancestral environment of primates uniquely affected them to link vision with automatic, fast, accurate, and adjustable reaching and grasping, and to improve upon vision as a way to detect and avoid predators, both automatically and with conscious awareness.

> If it is true that predators were the primary selective pressure operating on mammals to favor this initial expansion of the LGN visual system, then we should expect some degree of coordinated timing between when the preadtor appeared and when the mammalian LGN visual system appeared, i.e., sometime before placental mammals and amrsupials diverged. If it is true that snakes, in particular, were the responsible preadtors, then we should expect them to have originated around that same time.
