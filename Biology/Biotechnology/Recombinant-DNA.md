**Recombinant DNA** (**rDNA**) molecules are [[DNA]] molecules combined from different sources.

One way to create recombinant DNA is using a [[restriction enzyme]]. Bacterial cells keep restriction enzymes to cut up foreign DNA, but they can be used to create specific cuts to make it easy to insert a fragment from a different DNA molecule. Here's how it works:

1. A selected restriction enzyme snips at the restriction site on a bacterial plasmid, leaving sticky ends
2. The same restriction enzyme is used to cut a fragment from a different DNA molecule
3. The sticky ends of the inserted DNA molecule and the plasmid connect
4. DNA ligase seals the strands
