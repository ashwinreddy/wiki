**Recombinant DNA** (**rDNA**) molecules are [[DNA]] molecules combined from different sources.

# Construction

One way to create recombinant DNA is using a [[restriction enzyme]]. Bacterial cells keep restriction enzymes to cut up foreign DNA, but they can be used to create specific cuts to make it easy to insert a fragment from a different DNA molecule. Here's how it works:

1. A selected restriction enzyme snips at the restriction site on a bacterial plasmid, leaving sticky ends
2. The same restriction enzyme is used to cut a fragment from a different DNA molecule
3. The sticky ends of the inserted DNA molecule and the plasmid connect
4. DNA ligase seals the strands

Another way is to use [[electroporation]].

# How to Check

How does one check whether it worked or not? Run a [[gel electrophoresis]].

How can we ensure that the gene will be expressed? One way is to use an [[expression vector]].

Yeast is sometimes a preferable alternative to bacteria. They are as easy to grow and also have plasmids but are eukaryotes.
