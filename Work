> Blessedness is not the reward of virtue, but is virtue itself; and we do not delight in it because we conquer our passions, but because we delight in it, we are able to conquer our passions. 

Spinoza's _Ethica_ is a [[Classic book]] in [[Philosophy]] written in [[Latin]] and published in 1677. I am using this handsome [edition](https://www.worldcat.org/title/spinozas-ethics/oclc/859948295&referer=brief_results) of the translation by George Eliot, edited by Clare Carlisle. 

## Of God

Spinoza equates substance with God-Nature. 

|Latin|English|
|-----|-------|
|_Per substantiam intellego id quod in se est et per se concipitur; hoc est id cuius conceptus non indiget conceptu alterius rei, a quo formari debeat._|I understand through 'substance' that which exists in itself and is conceived in itself; i.e. the conception of which does not require for its formation the conception of anything else.|


## On the Nature and Origin of the Mind

* Spinoza equates _reality_ and _perfection_.
