a canon ([[greek]] for ruler or measuring stick) is a [[technology]] that solves the problem of scoping the attention of a [[reading]] audience to a subset of edited, compiled, or anthologized works. In other words, the [[abstraction]] it creates is the simplification of a literary space through a selection of texts. Typically, a canon is made up of [[classic]]s. 

In [[christianity]], the [[bible]] serves as a canon. In fact, bible just means book, presenting it as the singular book.
