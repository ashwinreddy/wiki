technology is an organism's response to _[[chaos]] sive natura_ in the form of a [[problem]] as a "low-resistance path to an end."[^what-is-technology]

in [[the question concerning technology]], [[heidegger]] asks what technology is. the starting answer is that it is a means to an end and a [[human]] activity, because that's what positing ends and procuring and utilizing their means is. the core question is about instrumentality and within what do such things as means and ends belong. the answer is causality. heidegger will appeal to aristotle's theory of causation.

[[nabokov]] agrees with heidegger here. Completing the prompt "the great tragedy of modern art," he responds that "an artist cannot look at an airplane and see anything but a plane."

## tool vs. machine

a distinction brought up by [[deleuze]] (see appendix to [[anti-oedipus]])
