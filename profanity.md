profanity is a [[literary device]]. [[steven pinker]] talks about 5 reasons it's used

1. Dysphemistic swearing: I want you to think about how awful this is. I want to express offense. The opposite is [[euphemism]], to cover up the unpleasantness of thinking about this. 
2. Abusive swearing: intimidate or humiliate someone with other poetic devices. 
3. Idiomatic swearing
4. Emphatic swearing
5. Cathartic swearing. Response-cry theory: communicate to others strong emotional feeling.
