**Tmux** is a nifty tool that lets you split the terminal window using panes and hide processes so they don't die when you exit.

The default is `Ctrl-B`, but I've remapped this in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/ashwinreddy/dotfiles/blob/master/.tmux.conf#L1).

# Panes

Use `"` for horizontal and `%` for vertical.
