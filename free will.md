> A man can do as he wills, but not will as he wills.  -- [[schopenhauer]]

free will is the sense that we control ourselves. But everything we know tells us that matter behaves according to a combination of randomness or principles, i.e. physical law. An atom does not "choose" to do anything. Therefore, free will must be a concept of [[emergence]] if it is to be sensible at all. [This writeup](https://www.hugomontenegro.com/blog/the-absurdity-of-free-will) is also good. A thorough account of free will will also have to touch on [[causation]].
