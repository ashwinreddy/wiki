platonism starts with the theory of [[plato]]'s forms. You ask the question _what is X?_

- _eidos_ - "visible form"
- _morphe_ - "shape"
- _phainomena_ - "appearances"

## [[aristotle]]

Aristotle wants to differentiate the genus into a species with differentiation. Plato doesn't do this, not because he's less developed, but actually because he's leaving a space open. 

## reversal

a project by [[deleuze]] and [[nietzsche]].

From _Deleuze's Philosophical Lineage_.

Deleuze wants to overthrow Plato. As [[michel foucault]] said, "Overturn Platonism: what philosophy has not tried?" Both [[hegel]] and [[kant]] wanted to abolish the world of essences and the world of appearances. But this is trying to over-_come_, not over-_turn_. 

Rather, in returning to Plato, we need to bypass Aristotle and overturn Platonism from the inside, as if a sophist. Overturning Platonism means producing simulacra, beginning with a simulacra of Platonism itself. Overturning "can only occur by virtue of denying the primacy of original over copy, of model over image; glorifying the reign of simulacra and reflections" ([[difference and repetition]]). The overturning will conserve many Platonic characteristics. He introduced transcendence, but not completely, for he left a possibility of the insubordination of difference since the Idea belongs to a field of immanence. It has not yet calcified into the structure and powers of the One, the Analogous, the Similar, and the Negative.
