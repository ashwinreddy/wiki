_amor ludi_ is a [[love]] of the [[game]]. it's a [[concept]] i'm trying to build out more in a [[metamodern]] way. the [[problem]] is this: what does it mean to play for the love of the [[game]]?

there's something to be learned from [[existentialism]] without making [[meaningness]] a pivotal question of life. some combination of investigating [[vervaeke]]'s ideas and [[amor fati]] is needed.
