_amor ludi_ is a love of the [[game]]. it's a [[concept]] i'm trying to build out more. the [[problem]] is this:

what does it mean to play for the love of the [[game]]?

solution:

there's something to be learned from [[existentialism]] without making [[meaningness]] a pivotal question of life. some combination of investigating [[vervaeke]]'s ideas and [[amor fati]] is needed.
