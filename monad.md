the monad is a [[concept]] from [[leibniz]] of a self-sufficient substance prior to relations. each monad has its own perspective. for [[deleuze]], there are 2 key ideas here:

1. the whole of life is nothing more than a plane of perceptions.
2. we perceive our world in terms of the relations from our point of view.
