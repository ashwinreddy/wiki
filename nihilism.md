nihilism is the view that nothing matters. 

> nihilism as an “ideology of nothing” would mean not that we adhere to a discernible system of beliefs about nothingness, but rather that the beliefs we have, or think we have, are equivalent to nothing. -- nolen gertz

gertz says nihilism starts with [[plato]]'s allegory of the cave, which is the possibility of a completely illusory life. The cave is dangerous. Gertz sees [[descartes]] as picking up that thread as well, then [[hume]] who challenges the typical notions of seeing through reality. This brings [[kant]] into the picture, rescuing knowledge from [[hume]]. [[nietzsche]] then comes in to diagnose the whole problem. 

TODO: [[deleuze]] also writes about nihilism.
