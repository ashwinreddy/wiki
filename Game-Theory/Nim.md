**Nim** is an impartial [[combinatorial game]] where player can remove arbitrary number of positive chips from any pile of many piles. The terminal state is that no chips are left.

For any $n$, $(n, n)$ is a P state. Clearly, $(0,0)$ and $(1, 1)$ are P states. We can proceed with strong induction. So we have $(k, k)$ a P state for some $k$. Now consider $(k+1, k+1)$. W.l.o.g. a player at this state will have to take it to $(k+1, l)$ for some $l < k$. But then a player at this state could take it down to $(l, l)$ which is a P state.
