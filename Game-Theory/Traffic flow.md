**Traffic/network flow game** consists of a [[directed graph]] with edges annotated by latency function $\ell_e(x)$ gives the cost if $x$ amount of traffic uses edge $e$ as well as a start and end node.

A strategy here is an element of $\Delta_N$, a [[probability mass function]] over the $N$ paths from start to end.

Socially optimal traffic flow
: Partition of traffic minimizing average latency.

[[Price of anarchy]]

# [[Nash equilibrium]]

We want no driver to be able to take another path that has lower cost.

# Braess Paradox

Adding capacity to a system can result in increase of average driver travel time in equilibrium.
