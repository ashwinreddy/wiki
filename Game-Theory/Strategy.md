A **strategy** for a [[combinatorial game]] is a map from positions to arrows incident on that position.

Mixed strategy
: Assignment of probability to each pure strategy.

Pure strategy
: A deterministic mixed strategy.

# Safety Strategy

For a [[zero-sum game]], player I is picking $\arg\max_x x^\mathsf{T} A y$ and player II is picking $\arg\min_y x^\mathsf{T}Ay$. A safety strategy will yield an expected gain/loss of at least/most $V$, the value of the game.
