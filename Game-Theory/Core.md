A **core** in a [[cooperative game]] is an allocation $\psi(v)$ when the [[characteristic function|transferable utility#characteristic-function]] $v$ has been supplied. We require 

Efficiency
: The players extract the maximum possible total value, $$\sum_{i=1}^n \psi_i = v\left(\\{ 1, \dots, n\\}\right).$$
