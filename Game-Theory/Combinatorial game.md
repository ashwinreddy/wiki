A **combinatorial game** has 2 players, a [[set]] of positions $X$, a subset of positions called terminal sets that indicate a win for a player, and legal moves from each player and position. It is either [[impartial game]] or a [[partisan game]].

Progressively bounded
: A combinatorial game is progressively bounded if for any starting position, the game ends in a finite number of steps

A game with "loops" between states won't be progressively bounded.

# Examples

The chomp game.
