A **combinatorial game** has 2 players, a [[set]] of positions $X$, a subset of positions called terminal sets that indicate a win for a player, and legal moves from each player and position.

Progressively bounded
: A combinatorial game is progressively bounded if for any starting position, the game ends in a finite number of steps

A game with "loops" between states won't be progressively bounded.

# Examples

The chomp game.

The subtraction game, where players can remove up to a certain number of chips from a pile of chips. Say you have 5 chips and each player can remove up to 4 chips. Then, the 2nd player always wins, no matter what.

Say you have 6 chips. Then, A _could_ force a win by playing smart.
