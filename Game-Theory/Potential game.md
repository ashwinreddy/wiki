A **potential game** is a special case of a [[general sum game]] where the utility function $\phi(k_i, k_{-i}) - \phi(k'\_i, k_{-i}) = u_i(k_i, k_{-i})-u_i(k_i', k_{-i})$. In other words, $\phi$ is agnostic to the player $i$!


Every potential game must have a pure [[Nash equilibrium]] and we can get there with a greedy algorithm.
