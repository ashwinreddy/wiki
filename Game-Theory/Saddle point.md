A **saddle point** is a value in a [[payoff matrix]] that is minimal in its row and maximal in its column. For example,

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
4 & 5 \\\\
3 & 2 
\end{bmatrix}
$$


Formally, pair $(i^\*, j^\*)$ such that $$\max_i a_{ij^\*} = a_{i^\* j^\*} = \min\_j a_{i\^* j}.$$ 


If there's a saddle point, then it's the value of the game -- neither player has incentive to deviate. It's a pure [[Nash equilibrium]]
