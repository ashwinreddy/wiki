A **saddle point** is a value in a [[payoff matrix]] that is minimal in its row (so the column player prefers it) and maximal in its column (so the row player likes it). For example,

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
\underline{4} & 5 \\\\
3 & 2 
\end{bmatrix}
$$


If there's a saddle point, then it's the value of the game -- neither player has incentive to deviate. It's a pure [[Nash equilibrium]]
