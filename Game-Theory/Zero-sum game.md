A **zero-sum game** is one where the cost of losing is the benefit of winning so that the total payoff across players is 0.

# Value

\begin{equation}
V = \max_x \min_y x^\mathsf{T} C y = \min_y \max_x x^\mathsf{T} C y \tag{Value}
\end{equation}

# Solutions

## Saddle points

Saddle point
: An outcome $C_{ij}$ that is minimal in row $i$ and maximal in column $j$.

If there's a saddle point, then it's the value of the game -- neither player has incentive to deviate.


## Domination

## Principle of Indifference
