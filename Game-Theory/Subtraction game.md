A **subtraction game** is a [[combinatorial game]] involves reducing the number of chips in a game subtractively.


# [[Sprague-Grundy theorem]]

For allowed subtractions $\\{1, 2, \dots, k\\}$, the function is

\begin{equation}
g(x) = x \mod (k + 1)
\end{equation}

Clearly, the 0 state is losing. What this function tells us is that any state is good except for a multiple of $k-1$, which is a losing one.

Suppose you can take up to 4 chips. Then, if you see 5 chips, you're screwed. You cannot take the last chip, no matter what.
