**Transferable utility** in a [[cooperative game]] means that players can trade utility on the side. 

# Example

For example, if a right-handed glove seller _A_ and two left-handed glove sellers _B_ and _C_ want to sell a pair of gloves to a customer, they will need to split the profit stably. 

We introduce a **characteristic function** $v$ defined on any subset of the the three players. Then,

$$
v\left(\\{A, B, C \\}\right) = v\left(\\{A, B\\}\right) = v\left(\\{A, C\\}\right) = 1.
$$

and every other subset is 0.

# Characteristic Function

$$
v(\nullset) = 0.
