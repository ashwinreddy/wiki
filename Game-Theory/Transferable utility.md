**Transferable utility** in a [[cooperative game]] means that players can trade utility on the side. Let's say there are two players with payoff matrices $A$ and $B$. 

1. Maximize the total utility. Concretely, find the maximal entry of $A+B$.
2. Decide how to split the utility. In the [[zero-sum game]] with payoff matrix $A-B$, find safety strategies $x_\*$ and $y_*$, called threat strategies, and let $\delta$ denote the value of the game. The disagreement point is $(d_1, d_2) = (x_\*^\mathsf{T} A y_\*, x_\*^\mathsf{T} B y_\*)$
