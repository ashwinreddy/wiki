**Transferable utility** in a [[cooperative game]] means that players can trade utility on the side. 

# Example

For example, if a right-handed glove seller and two left-handed glove sellers want to sell a pair of gloves to a customer, they will need to split the profit stably. 

We introduce a **characteristic function** $v$ defined on any subset of the the three players. Then,

$$
v(\\{1, 2, 3 \\}) = v(12) = v(13) = 1.
$$
