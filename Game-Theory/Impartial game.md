An **impartial game** is a [[combinatorial game]] whose [[set]] of moves is independent of player. Chess is _not_ an impartial game since the players control mutually exclusive pieces.

For an impartial, progressively bounded combinatorial game, and $N$ the set of positions where the next player can guarantee a win and $P$ the set of positions where the other player can guarantee a win, provided they play optimally:

$$
X = N \cup P.
$$

Simply put, someone has to be able to force a win.

# Subtraction

Starting with a pile of $x \in \mathbb{N}$ chips, two players alternate taking 1 to 4 chips. Removing the last chip is a win. Note that $B(x) = x$ since at least 1 chip is removed each step.
