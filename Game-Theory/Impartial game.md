An **impartial game** is a [[combinatorial game]] whose [[set]] of moves is independent of player. Chess is _not_ an impartial game since the players control mutually exclusive pieces.

For an impartial, progressively bounded combinatorial game, and $N$ the set of positions where the next player can guarantee a win and $P$ the set of positions where the other player can guarantee a win, provided they play optimally:

$$
X = N \cup P
$$
