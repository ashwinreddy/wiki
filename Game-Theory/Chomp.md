**Chomp** is a game where the goal is to _not_ eat the bottom left corner of a chocolate bar.

Any rectangular Chomp is always an N state.

# Proof

To show it is N, we have to show there is an arrow leading to a P state. We'll use strategy stealing. 

**Observation:** The first player can steal whatever strategy the second player has.

Assume the 1st player has no winning strategy. Then the 2nd player can guarantee a win. But the first player can steal their strategy, so they do have a winning strategy.
