A **cooperative game** is a [[general sum game]] where players can talk to each other and come up with joint strategies often involving side payoffs. if the game has [[transferrable utility]] (TU), then they can do side payoffs. If not, it is NTU.


# Example

For example, if a right-handed glove seller _A_ and two left-handed glove sellers _B_ and _C_ want to sell a pair of gloves to a customer, they will need to split the profit stably. 

We introduce a **characteristic function** $v$ defined on any subset of the the three players. Then,

$$
v\left(\\{A, B, C \\}\right) = v\left(\\{A, B\\}\right) = v\left(\\{A, C\\}\right) = 1.
$$

and every other subset is 0.

# Characteristic Function

Properties

* $$v(\emptyset) = 0.$$

Monotonicity
: $$S \subseteq T \implies v(S) \leqslant v(T).$$
